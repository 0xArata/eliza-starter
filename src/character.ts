            "# Proof of Liquidity: Points, but better\n\n## Playing longterm games \n\nLiquidity is the lifeblood of onchain activity. Over the past cycle, we've seen several short-term approaches to acquiring liquidity, many of which have revolved around points and grants. Sometimes this liquidity is put to use productively in the ecosystem, but most of the time, it’s just used to hit some CEX listing metric or spur a short wave of onchain activity in hopes of ultimately affecting token price. The industry is fundamentally ruled by mercenary actors and correlated incentive design. Berachain believes that to build an ecosystem that stands the test of time, we must optimize for long-term games from the start. \n\nRecent TGEs highlight the one-sided relationship between those who provide liquidity and those who reward them, perhaps most readily seen in recent LRT launches. The protocol locks liquidity, benefits from it, and decides how LPs are rewarded. Some teams may brush frustrations off as entitled airdrop farmers, but others recognize that protocols use these deposit stats to demonstrate traction for private fundraising and forming partnerships without actually finding a way to make those users whole. \n\nAside from pissing off users and destroying public sentiment (which tends to snowball into price action), one of the biggest issues with the current meta is that, after launch, mercenary users simply withdraw their funds and move their liquidity to the next farm. As a new protocol pops up, liquidity gets sucked from existing ecosystems as users rush to extract fresh value - sometimes aptly described as “New Coin Good, Old Coin Bad.” Few can capture liquidity and users long-term, as the opportunity cost of keeping mercenary capital locked without receiving rewards is high. Obviously, this is a great strategy for quick user acquisition but a really poor one for user retention. \n\nSo, how does one ultimately tackle this problem? \n\nBerachain sees this as a two-part equation. First, give users and providers of liquidity as much flexibility and influence as possible, reducing the need to leave the protocol. Second, ensure that the stack of users, applications, and validators is aligned and that each party can benefit from the effort and/or capital expended on the chain. This is where Proof of Liquidity enters the equation—Berachain’s PoL makes liquidity liquid and realigns value flows across the network to reward the parties contributing the most to the ecosystem in a systemic way. \n\n## Proof of Liquidity 101\n\nProof of Liquidity is a mechanism for incentivizing and rewarding productive capital with BGT, Berachain’s governance/emissions token. Here’s a brief overview of how the three stakeholder groups participate in PoL:\n\nValidators: Earn block rewards based on the amount of BGT delegated to them and can earn applications’ tokens in exchange for directing BGT emissions to applications’ rewards vaults via “incentives.”\n\nApplications: Can set bounties on the validator marketplace for BGT rewards to incentivize validators to direct BGT emissions to them in exchange for a reward, usually in the form of the protocol’s native token. Applications and validators work together to bootstrap liquidity for an application’s token or the application itself. \n\nUsers: Supply liquidity to eligible liquidity venues (pools, vaults, etc.) to accumulate BGT rewards and earn applicable LP fees. Users may also delegate BGT to a validator to earn a portion of the incentives received from applications receiving emissions from that validator. \n\nAs a user in proof of liquidity, instead of locking capital for the sole purpose of network security, capital is provided to the ecosystem to earn block rewards (BGT), which in turn may be delegated to a validator contributing to network security. Validators are incentivized to maximize BGT delegated, as their rewards for block-building (and commissions) scale with BGT. As a result, different strategies will emerge to optimize the attractiveness of delegation- this can be social (offering value through community and/or incubation) or economic (incentivizing delegators through a revenue share). \n\nVia a larger BGT delegation, validators can also work with more protocols through the aforementioned bounty marketplace. This allows them to access new revenue streams while helping new dApps on the chain bootstrap liquidity and user bases. Users will look for a validator that is incentive-aligned with them. For example, if a user is invested in protocol X, they’d probably prefer to delegate to a validator directing a portion of their emissions to a vault or LP corresponding to that protocol. \n\nGame theory for stakeholders:\n\nValidators: Win by maximizing BGT delegations and servicing protocol liquidity bounties, creating profitability through efficient collaboration with applications.\nApplications: Win by working with validators to bootstrap liquidity and directly incentivizing users with BGT emissions, enhancing capital efficiency compared to standard liquidity mining programs.\nUsers: Win by providing liquidity to applications they use and delegating BGT emissions to aligned validators, earning incentives and maximizing returns on their stake.\n\nBerachain has been described as a “playground for infinite economic games”. \n\nThe alignment above is meant to allow Berachain to also serve as “an infinite playground for economic games” - same, same, but different. \n\n## PoL is points, but better\n\n> **Note:**\n> \n> \"Tokens having cash flows from the fees earned by their respective protocols will be one of the biggest unlocks for the crypto ecosystem. The only reason most don't is for fear of being incorrectly labeled as a security.\"\n> \n> — Viktor Bunin 🛡️ (@ViktorBunin) May 20, 2024\n\nWhy do points kind of work (on a short term time horizon)?\n\nThey offer an additional form of speculation prior to a token (the primary form)\nThey’re generally non-transferable and illiquid, making it harder for people to price them properly\nProtocols retroactively determine what those points will “cost” them- in terms of token allocation in “post” - once the value has already mostly been extracted from them (through metric boosting, via points farming)\nOn the other hand, \n\nUsers have no control over how points are distributed\nPoints lack any form of intrinsic floor value or ability to proxy for the potential value of their corresponding tokens \nPoints often have unknown or highly variable distribution periods, preventing anyone from effectively knowing ownership of “the pie” at any point \nWhat if there was a way to systemically reward those contributing the most protocol value? Instead of participating in a one-sided game where the protocol holds all the cards, users participate in a transparent system where they can weigh the real opportunity cost of capital. Berachain’s proof of liquidity is points, but better. \n\nProof of liquidity is a mechanism that incentivizes sticky liquidity through systemic rewards for users who provide productive capital to the ecosystem. There’s no more free lunch for value extraction on either side. Any capital provided to the ecosystem is put to work, creating deeper liquidity and, as a result, better execution prices and outcomes for users and dApps. Proof of liquidity is a dance where validators, applications, and users interact to align financial and social interests through BGT- the governance token emission from the Berachain network. To earn BGT, users provide liquidity to ecosystem applications. As a user, BGT gives holders rights to a percentage of the fees generated from native dapp use, influences which reward vaults are incentivized through governance, and can be delegated to a validator to earn a portion of the validator’s incentives.  BGT allows users who contributed value to the system to determine who should be rewarded the most.\n\nPoL is a more efficient way of allocating emissions/liquidity because it's recursive to the onchain activity of actual users and product growth instead of being the result of sybil usage. BGT is also adjustable in real-time and controlled by users, dApps, and validators, all seeking to align their game-theoretic optimal outcomes. New projects can be added via governance for eligibility to receive BGT emissions, creating a constant cycle with fluctuating incentives. \n\n## Berachain: Protocol-level incentive alignment\n\nCrypto is inherently a game of aligning incentives and finding ways to maximize capital. In other ecosystems, the relationship between users, validators, and applications is fragmented at best. At its core, proof of liquidity makes it easier for applications to acquire users and liquidity and provides validators with differentiated revenue streams from collaborating with those protocols.\n\nPoints are the most popular method of bootstrapping onchain activity and growth, serving to value some future token that may exist in exchange for providing some action or liquidity to a network. However, the distribution and value of points are entirely determined by a single centralized entity and are inherently short-term, leaving a sudden liquidity vacuum and an imbalance between protocol security and economic activity. This leads to a snowball effect that ends with no new users, no new apps, and shrinking validator participation. Ultimately, Berachain’s Proof of Liquidity paradigm shifts the focus from short-term gains to sustainable, long-term growth. By creating an environment where value is distributed to those who contribute, players are incentivized to play long-term games.",

This paper builds \n\non earlier OECD work on DeFi and markets for crypto-assets and contributes to the growing empirical \n\nanalysis on the characteristics of activity in DeFi lending pools and decentralised exchanges. \n\nThe empirical analysis is based on an original on-chain transaction-level dataset of three of the largest \n\nDeFi lending protocols for the period between December 2020 and December 2022. The analysis focuses \n\non liquidations data of these DeFi lending protocols and provides evidence of a positive relation between \n\nliquidations and post-liquidations price volatility across the main DEX pools. Without directly observing the \n\nbehaviour of liquidators, these findings indicate that liquidators require market liquidity to carry out swaps \n\nassociated with large liquidations and affect market conditions while doing so. In particular, price volatility \n\nincreases in the presence of frequent liquidations. \n\nThe paper also discusses liquidity conditions in a set of lending pools examined in the analysis and \n\nhighlights the importance of sufficient liquidity for the functioning of liquidations. In particular, drawing on \n\nthe analysis of the examined lending pools, it appears that at extreme events when investors pursue the \n\nsame strategy at large numbers, liquidity of a particular asset may dry up in each of the pools across \n\nprotocols. This implies that the liquidation mechanism might be limited in its ability to restore liquidity, as \n\nliquidators themselves rely on the liquidity available in the pools to repay underwater loans. Notably, \n\nliquidators’ ability to liquidate is constrained and will depend on ‘exogenous’ liquidity provision, if the under\n\ncollateralised debt is denominated in a scarcely available or volatile asset, and if liquidity is absent and \n\nborrowing is expensive. \n\nThe analysis finds a positive correlation among borrowing rates in the three large lending pools examined \n\nand across different assets, which indicates that the liquidity in DeFi lending pools examined is connected. \n\nThis finding implies a possible further risk of intensification of illiquidity. It suggests that based on the pools \n\nexamined, investors often pursue similar strategies in DeFi lending protocols. This kind of herding \n\nbehaviour may further intensify liquidity shortages in lending pools as assets are used as collateral in a \n\nsimultaneous manner. Low liquidity in a lending pool will translate into the inability of depositors to withdraw \n\ntheir deposits. Though depositors are made aware that their ability to withdraw depends on the available \n\nliquidity, the over-collateralisation method might downplay the risk associated with liquidity provision in the \n\neyes of investors. Because the net leverage position of investors is not taken into account, rather each \n\ndeposit-borrow transaction is considered as a stand-alone for risk assessment purposes, an inherent \n\nfeature in an anonymised market, participants can quickly and significantly leverage, even if their initial \n\ncapital is low, which can dry up liquidity in the pools. \n\n\n**1.1. DeFi lending protocols** \n\nLending and borrowing protocols and decentralised exchanges (DEXs) have been two of the most popular \n\ntypes of DeFi protocols deployed on chain, alongside staking protocols (OECD, 2022[1]). DeFi lending and \n\nborrowing protocols enable users to obtain leverage through borrowing tokens against collateral. There is \n\nalso the possibility to take out a flash loan (borrowing and repayment are carried out in the same \n\ntransaction) without having to provide collateral. Adjustable interest rate payments, transferred from \n\nborrowers to depositors (with a share going to the platform), are the main mechanism used to maintain \n\ndemand and supply equilibrium for sufficient liquidity to remain, because quantity adjustment is very much \n\nlimited, especially for smaller, scarcely available, crypto assets (see an example in Section 3 ). Different \n\nlending protocols are similar in the sense that they are not assuming any risk on their balance sheet, and \n\nthat all credit and liquidity risks are carried out by users. Lending protocols include automated liquidation \n\nprocedures, to liquidate positions that fall under the prespecified under-collateralisation limit (see \n\nSection 1.2). \n\nThe analysis in this paper uses historical transaction-level data on several leading lending and borrowing \n\nprotocols: Aave, Compound and Maker for the period between 1 December 2020 and 8 December 2022. \n\n 1 \n\nAs of 22 March 2023, Maker, Aave V2 and Compound were the three top lending protocols in terms of \n\ndeposited amount (DeBank, 2023[2]). The data breaks down the five types of transactions possible in the \n\npools: deposit, withdrawal, borrowing, repayment and liquidation, with characteristics associated with the \n\ntransactions such as the asset involved, the interest rate prevailing at the time, and the user address \n\nperforming the action. Figure 1. 1 presents the cumulative deposited amount of ETH/WETH \n\n 2 \n\n in these \n\nlending protocols since the beginning of the sample. \n\n1 \n\n Original datasets provided by cryptocurrency market data provider Kaiko. \n\n2 \n\n WETH is the ERC-20 tradable version of ETH. ERC-20 tokens can only be traded with other ERC-20 token. Crypto \n\nwallets and exchanges on Ethereum network natively support ERC-20 tokens and make WETH more useful in DeFi. \n\nTo generate WETH a person must send their ETH to a smart contract that then provides WETH in return. The wrapping \n\nratio is 1 to 1 but gas fees still need to be paid for the wrapping operation. This means that WETH created is backed \n\nup by ETH reserves. Alternatively, it is possible to swap another token for WETH using a crypto exchange. \n\n# 1 Liquidations in DeFi lending \n\n## protocols \n\n\n**Figure 1. 1. Comparison of cumulative amount of ETH/WETH deposited in lending protocols** \n\nIn USD billions, as of 5 December 2022 \n\nNote: Cumulative amount of ETH or WETH (depending on the protocol options) deposited into lending pools since 1 December 2020. \n\nSource: Kaiko and OECD calculations. \n\nThe maximum amount that can be borrowed by a user from a lending pool depends on the asset that was \n\nsupplied as collateral, the asset that the user wishes to borrow and the available liquidity in the pool. The \n\nvalue of collateral should remain well above the value of the loan, in a continuous manner, throughout the \n\nlife of the loan. If the ratio between the value of the borrowed assets and the value of the supplied collateral \n\ndeclines below a pre-defined threshold, the borrowing position becomes under-collateralised and eligible \n\nfor liquidation. The numeric representation of the safety of the collateral against the borrowed assets is \n\nsometimes called the ‘health factor’ or the ‘collateral factor’. \n\nThe strategies that have been followed in the past two years by investors in lending protocols were either \n\ntaking a long position when the expectation is that volatile crypto asset prices will rise, or a short position \n\nin the opposite market sentiment (Carey and Melachrinos, 2022[3]). A long position requires the deposit of \n\na volatile asset (ETH/BTC), which becomes the collateral, and the borrowing of another (usually less \n\nvolatile, uncorrelated or negatively correlated with the collateral) asset, which is the debt asset, such as a \n\nstablecoin. The less volatile asset might then be exchanged for the volatile asset in an exchange, and the \n\nuser can perform another set of deposit and borrowing actions to increase their leverage. This can happen \n\nseveral times as there is no monitoring of leverage by the platform on a cumulative basis. If the volatile \n\nasset increases in price, a profit is made from the change in the price ratio of the volatile asset against the \n\n“stable” asset. If instead the price declines, the position should be liquidated. A short position would be the \n\nopposite – the deposit of a “stable” asset and borrowing of a volatile asset. Other types of investments are \n\nalso possible through borrowing such as staking or investment in derivatives. The possibilities of \n\nunrestricted leverage allowed by such strategies was one of the key drivers of the rise of popularity of DeFi \n\nlending protocols (OECD, 2022 [1] \n\n ). \n\n**1.2. DeFi Liquidations** \n\nA liquidation is a process that occurs when a borrower’s ‘health factor’ drops below 1 or if the value of the \n\ncollateral drops below the ‘liquidation ratio’ defined by the protocol. This might happen when the collateral \n\ndecreases in value or the borrowed debt increases in value. A rise in the borrowing interest rate is also a \n\n\nway that results in a deterioration in the health factor as the loan increases in nominal value. In a liquidation, \n\na liquidator repays part of the underwater debt and receives from the protocol in return part of the collateral \n\nthat was deposited at a discount price compared to the current market price. Some protocols execute \n\nauctions with a bidding process for the liquidation of the collateral (Maker) while others allow instant \n\nliquidation by liquidators for a pre-determined bonus/incentive (Aave, Compound). \n\n 3 \n\n Platforms differ in the \n\nmechanism used to determine who will be able to liquidate the debt, but in general, this function is open to \n\nany user. Previously, (Qin et al., 2021[4]) found that different liquidation designs well incentivise liquidators \n\nin terms of the profit that liquidators make, with the result of excessive amounts of discounted collateral \n\nbeing sold at the borrowers’ expenses. \n\nThe dataset used in this analysis allows to identify the asset pairs that were involved in liquidations on the \n\ncollateral and on the debt sides (Figure 1. 2 ). Most frequently during the sample period, debt that was \n\nliquidated had been borrowed in “stablecoins” such as USDC, USDT or DAI, with collateral pledged in \n\nvolatile assets, such as WETH and WBTC. It is important to note that borrowing in Maker is only possible \n\nin the token DAI, while collateral can be provided in a variety of assets. The liquidation pairs frequency \n\nimplies that the investment strategies that were most often liquidated were of users expecting to profit from \n\nan increase in the price of volatile crypto assets. Such strategies were negatively affected during the sharp \n\nprice declines in 2022 H1, eventually leading to the default of service providers in the crypto assets that \n\nhad their business model rely on participation in such lending protocols (OECD, 2022[5]). Indeed, many \n\nliquidations across the lending pools occurred in 2022 H1 (Figure 1. 3 ). \n\n**Figure 1. 2. Most frequent pairs of liquidated debt and collateral** \n\nFrequency of liquidation pairs as of 8 December 2022, for Aave V1, Aave V2, Compound V2 and Maker pools \n\nNote: Frequency of liquidated collateral-debt pairs for top five liquidated debt assets and top five liquidated collateral assets. These liquidation \n\npairs account for 78% of all liquidated transactions in the data sample. Pools included in the analysis are Aave V1, Aave V2, Compound V2 and \n\nMaker. Though Maker is used less often than Aave V2 and Compound, it only allows to borrow DAI, so liquidations from this pool will always \n\nhave DAI as the liquidated debt. \n\nSource: Kaiko and OECD calculations. \n\n3 \n\n Liquidation fees and penalties also apply and differ depending on the protocol. \n\n\n**Figure 1. 3. Liquidations from leading lending pools over time** \n\nNote: Daily number of liquidation transactions carried out in Aave V1, Aave V2, Compound and Maker. \n\nSource: Kaiko and OECD calculations. \n\nDuring the sample period and for the protocols in the dataset, close to 50 000 liquidations took place only \n\nof USDC and USDT denominated debt. Though liquidations are open, in theory, to the participation of any \n\nuser, and borrowing positions eligible for liquidation are publicly displayed, industry reports claim that most \n\nliquidations are performed by bots (Qin et al., 2021[4]). The data in the sample points to concentration of \n\nliquidators; it indicates that 530 distinct user addresses have executed the 50 000 liquidations, with top 10 \n\nliquidators responsible for 60 % of the liquidation transactions. \n\n\n# 2 DeFi liquidations and volatility \n\n## impact \n\n**2.1. The connection between lending pools and DEXs** \n\nThis chapter outlines the methodology and results of the analysis of the effect of liquidations in DeFi on \n\nprice volatility in DEXs. Specifically, we assess the impact of liquidations involving a particular pair of debt \n\nand collateral assets on the price volatility of these two assets when exchanged one against the other on \n\nDEXs in the period between 1 December 2020 until 8 December 2022. If the data portrays evidence that \n\nliquidations are associated with wider fluctuations in the price of underlying crypto assets on DEXs, it will \n\npoint to a major risk posed by the liquidations mechanism of adding systemic risk to the system. Because \n\nliquidations tend to occur during adverse market conditions, the liquidation mechanism, designed to \n\nmaintain the stability of lending pools, contributes to the negative dynamic of a distress episode through \n\nmore volatility in the spot market. \n\nWe expect that if liquidators have a preference to avoid holding large capital, to not expose themselves to \n\nthe risk of exchange rate fluctuation, there will be increased swapping activity associated with an increase \n\nin liquidations. If liquidators require loans to repay the under-collateralised debt, then that increases the \n\nlikelihood that they will swap the received collateral back to the debt asset to repay their loans. This \n\nconjecture regarding the preference of liquidators to avoid holding large capital pre and post liquidations \n\nis supported by the claim that most liquidations are apparently performed by bots and by an overall small \n\nnumber of active users that carry out liquidations in the lending pools examined (see Section 1.2). If \n\nliquidators use their own capital to repay the under-collateralised debt, then they do not have to trade post \n\nliquidation, but might still prefer to do so to lock in their profit. Thus, the analysis provided in the paper also \n\nsheds light on the magnitude of swaps taking place after liquidations. \n\nA study by Lehar and A. Parlour (2022[6]) documented a price impact of trades performed by liquidators on \n\ndifferent DEXs. They focused on the price impact of liquidations on DEXs, where the liquidator swapped \n\nthe collateral for the debt asset in the same transaction where the liquidation was recorded, including flash \n\nloans and liquidations in which another asset was swapped for the debt asset in order to recover the \n\ncollateral. In contrast, the available dataset does not allow us to witness the transactions carried out by \n\nliquidators around the liquidation event and be able to directly assess their use of pre-available capital \n\ncompared with flash loans and swaps. In this analysis, the variable of interest is all liquidations involving a \n\npair of two tokens, and its relation to fluctuations in the price of the following trades taking place on DEXs. \n\n\n**Box 2. 1. Decentralised exchanges (DEX)** \n\n A DEX is a peer-to-peer marketplace where users can trade cryptocurrencies in a non-custodial \n\n manner. There are several DEX designs, with automated market makers (AMMs) being the most widely \n\n used. Instead of an order book, an AMM utilises a liquidity pool that traders can swap their tokens \n\n against, with the price determined by an algorithm based on the proportion of tokens in the pool, usually \n\n a pair of such tokens. Liquidity is supplied to the DEX pools by liquidity providers, and liquidity events \n\n relate to the addition or removal of (often pairs of) tokens to/from a liquidity pool. \n\n Order book DEXs have been less common in DeFi and suffered from low liquidity, as they require every \n\n interaction within the order book to be posted on the blockchain. To overcome this complexity and \n\n associated cost, some exchanges employ a hybrid order book design, where the order book \n\n management and matching processes take place off-chain while the settlement of trades occurs on\n\n chain. Importantly, reserves and prices in AMM exchanges are updated automatically every time a trade \n\n takes place. Users can get instant access to liquidity, while liquidity providers (depositors into the AMM’s \n\n liquidity pool) can earn passive income via trading fees that are paid for the swaps. Liquidity is essential \n\n for AMMs to function properly; If an AMM doesn’t have a sufficient liquidity in the pool, it can give rise \n\n to a large price impact when traders buy and sell assets. \n\n Source: OECD (2022 [1] \n\n ) Why Decentralised Finance (DeFi) Matters and the Policy Implications, https://www.oecd.org/finance/why\n\n decentralised-finance-defi-matters-and-the-policy-implications.htm, Chainlink (2023 [7] \n\n ) Automated Market Makers (AMMs) Explained, \n\n https://chain.link/education-hub/what-is-an-automated-market-maker-amm, Coindesk (2023 [8] \n\n ) What Is an Automated Market Maker? \n\n AMMs Explained, https://www.coindesk.com/learn/what-is-an-automated-market-maker/. \n\n**2.2. Data and methodology** \n\nThe main hypothesis of this analysis postulates that liquidations increase the volatility of the price of the \n\npair of assets involved in a liquidation, as discussed, because on the one hand, liquidators want to lock in \n\ntheir profit and remain unexposed to fluctuations in the price of volatile assets and because, on the other \n\nhand, of insufficient liquidity in the crypto market. We choose to focus in the test on liquidations of USDC \n\ndebt with collateral denominated in ETH or WETH. According to Figure 1. 2 , this has been one of the most \n\nfrequent liquidated debt-collateral pairs. In addition, both ETH and USDC are among the most liquid and \n\nhighly capitalised assets in the crypto space, so testing the effect for this pair will provide large number of \n\nobservations and an effect measured for overall liquid assets where volatility impact should be minimal. \n\nData on lending protocols covers three of the leading decentralised venues: AAVE (V1 \n\n 4 \n\n and V2), \n\nCompound and Maker. The five transactions available on these three protocols, known as events, \n\nconstitute: borrowings, deposits, repayments, withdrawals, and liquidations. For the purpose of this \n\nanalysis, we focus on liquidations. Data from Maker is irrelevant for the pair of USDC and ETH, as only \n\ndebt in DAI is lent and may be liquidated on Maker, we thus remain with liquidation data coming from AAVE \n\nV1 and V2 and Compound. \n\nTable 2. 1 presents the distribution of USDC debt collateralised by ETH liquidations among the lending \n\npools in the sample. A liquidation on average occurs every two hours; the median is however every \n\n48 seconds, pointing to the clustering of liquidations, or their tendency to occur in “waves”. Most \n\nliquidations in terms of value have taken place on AAVE V2 in this sample. Figure 2. 1 displays daily value \n\n4 \n\n The Aave community has gradually moved away from the V1 version after V2 was launched. The calculations in this \n\npaper still include the liquidations transactions in the tests, though these represent a small share of the overall \n\nobservations. \n\n\nof liquidations by lending protocol. It demonstrates that liquidations follow a volatile pattern, with some \n\nperiods without liquidations and others with high liquidation spikes. The spikes do not necessarily seem to \n\nbe correlated across the protocols, due to differences in individual borrowing positions value. \n\n**Table 2. 1.

Liquidations of USDC debt collateralised by ETH/WETH** \n\nSource: Kaiko and OECD calculations. \n\nLinear regression estimated with Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) is fitted to test for the effect that the value \n\nof liquidations may have on the price volatility on DEXs. The explanatory variable of interest is the amount \n\nof liquidated USDC debt collateralised by ETH, across AVVE V1 and V2, and Compound. The dependent \n\nvariable is the volatility of USDC/WETH price, which corresponds to the price prevailing in DEX liquidity \n\npools where WETH trades against USDC, reported each time a liquidity event in those pools takes place. \n\nData are sourced from Kaiko. On an AMM type of DEX, there can be two types of transactions – either a \n\nswap or a liquidity event. Swaps always occur between just two tokens, both should be available in the \n\npools. Liquidity pools generally contain two or more tokens and most DEXs require liquidity providers to \n\ndeposit pairs of tokens reflecting the current composition of the pool, which corresponds to the current \n\nprice of the deposited assets (Kaiko, 2023[9]). \n\n 5 \n\n Liquidity events are made by liquidity providers, who earn \n\nprofits from trading fees paid by traders. Thus, the more liquid a pool is and the more it is able to attract \n\n5 \n\n UnisSwap V3 allows for liquidity providers to pre-select their position on the supply curve of a traded pair of assets. \n\nBy choosing several parameters of their deposit, such as their fee tier and price range, their ratio of assets to be \n\nallocated to the pool will change. Thus, a continuum of ratios is possible. \n\n\nvolume, the more profits liquidity providers will receive. At the same time, because the withdrawn proportion \n\nof assets by a liquidity provider will depend on the prevailing price of tokens at the time of withdrawal, \n\nliquidity providers are subject to “impermanent loss” \n\n 6 \n\n. Every time a token is added or removed from a pool \n\nas a consequence of a swap, the price of the tokens adjusts. The larger the divergence of price that has \n\noccurred since depositing the liquidity, the larger will be the impermanent loss for the liquidity provider \n\n(CoinMarketCap, 2022[10]). \n\nIn terms of DEXs, Kaiko covers the most liquid Ethereum-based DEXs. Combined, these DEXs account \n\nfor the majority of decentralised trading activity across all blockchain networks (Kaiko, 2023[9]). Both trades \n\nand liquidity events are registered by Kaiko at transaction level data. USDC-WETH price for the purpose \n\nof the analysis is derived from swaps taking places on DEXs that offer an option to trade USDC versus \n\nWETH. Such DEXs are Uniswap V2 and V3; SushiSwap; Balancer, Balancer V2 and 1inch (Kaiko, \n\n2023 [11]). We use the Asset Price endpoint made available by Kaiko and retrieve an aggregated price that \n\nis based on all trades at all the covered exchanges which support spot markets for the pair USDC-WETH, \n\nas mentioned above, in 1 minute intervals (Kaiko, 2023[12]). \n\nThe price of USDC versus WETH derived from the swaps is depicted in Figure 2. 2. Sharp devaluations of \n\nWETH, such as those that occurred in 2021 H1 and 2022 H2 correspond to the significant increases in \n\nliquidated debt amounts shown earlier in Figure 2. 1. \n\n**Figure 2. 2. USDC-WETH price aggregated from swaps on DEXs** \n\nSource: Kaiko and OECD calculations. \n\nStandard methodology for high frequency trading data consists of estimating price volatility at constant \n\ntime intervals, rather than taking account of all observations available (Zhang, Mykland and Aït-Sahalia, \n\n2005 [13] \n\n ). This explains the decision to sample the aggregated swaps price data in constant one-minute \n\nintervals. In the baseline test, volatility is calculated over the following two-hours window, equivalent to 120 \n\nsuch one-minute price observations. Within each one-minute interval, there are usually seven to eight \n\ntrades, meaning that a shorter sampling interval will result in many observations carrying no new pricing \n\n6 \n\n Impermanent loss in DeFi occurs when the price of the assets deposited in DeFi liquidity pools changes compared \n\nto the price at the time the deposit was made. It indicates the loss incurred to the user by choosing to provide liquidity \n\nto the pool instead of just holding the asset. It is called “impermanent” because it is possible to recover such loss if the \n\nasset price returns to the initial exchange rate. \n\n\ninformation. The two-hours interval for volatility estimation is chosen to take the frequency of liquidations \n\nunder consideration. A liquidation wave, previously defined as a cluster of at least five liquidations in DeFi, \n\nwas measured to last on average 1. 63 hours (Lehar and Christine A. Parlour, 2022[6]). Choosing to \n\nmeasure the effect of liquidations on volatility over a two-hour horizon, i.e. considering a wave of \n\nliquidations as a single event, means to take the view of a systemic vulnerability analysis. In contrast, a \n\nshorter time horizon measure of volatility and liquidations dynamic would be more appropriate for \n\nassessing market efficiency. A two-hour horizon is chosen as the baseline. Nonetheless, robustness check \n\nis performed in Section 2.5 to compare the results of the analysis with a shorter time horizon. \n\nThe econometrical model follows most closely (Shum et al., 2016[14]) who test the relation between \n\npotential rebalancing needs of leveraged ETFs and intraday equity volatility using an OLS estimator. In \n\nterms of setting and rationale, their test is similar to the test here because the authors do not directly \n\nobserve the trades performed by ETFs, and consider instead the potential need for rebalancing as the \n\nmain explanatory variable of price volatility, in the same way that we do not observe the trading activity of \n\nliquidators, and conjecture that liquidators potentially need to trade after performing liquidations to adjust \n\ntheir portfolio composition or repay loans. In another work assessing the effect of ETF ownership on stock \n\nvolatility, Ben-David, Franzoni and Moussawi (2018[15]) also use an OLS framework. In contrast, it is \n\ncommon to use time series modelling for equity volatility forecasting. The limitations from using such setting \n\nfor the current analysis are, first, it is not aimed at forecasting volatility but at assessing a potential causal \n\neffect; and, second, the dynamics of liquidations do not seem to be appropriate for time series modelling \n\nas they tend to be of zero value for considerable time periods. Their persistency seems to be very short \n\nlived. Alternatively, we use lagged estimates of realised volatility within the OLS specification to account \n\nfor persistence in volatility. \n\nFrom the aggregated price of USDC-WETH sampled in one-minute intervals we produce continuously \n\ncompound returns by taking the difference of the natural logarithm of the price series. Realised volatility is \n\nthen measured as the square root of the average variance of returns, assuming the return has a zero\n\nmean. Specifically, volatility is measured as follows: \n\n ( 1 ) 𝑉𝑜𝑙 \n\n 𝑡+ 1 \n\n = √∑ 𝑟 \n\n 𝑡+𝑘 \n\n 2 \n\n 𝑡+ 1 \n\n 𝑘= 0 \n\nWhere 𝑟 𝑡+𝑘 \n\n is the logarithmic (continuously compounded) return of the price of USDC versus WETH \n\nmeasured each k interval (one-minute), from time 𝑡 and until two hours later (in the baseline case) denoted \n\nby 𝑡 + 1. Each volatility estimation is thus based on 120 return observations. \n\nVolatility data was constrained to match the sample of liquidations from 1 December 2020 until \n\n8 December 2022. Figure 2. 3 left hand side portrays the result of the realised volatility. There are some \n\nhigh results in the volatility estimation, measured during turbulent market periods such as 2021 H1 and \n\n2022 H2. On the right-hand side, the density distribution of the realised volatility is depicted. Most values \n\nlie below 0.05, with a long tail. \n\nDue to the non-negative nature of both volatility and liquidated debt, their spread-out and right skewed \n\ndistribution, we employ a logarithmic transformation on the dependent and independent variables. In effect \n\nthis means that we are testing the effect of change in liquidation amounts on the change in volatility. This \n\nimplies that we discard observations of zero liquidations. There is additional merit in using a logarithmic \n\ntransformation because liquidations tend to be very volatile, and of different magnitude (see Section 1.2). \n\n\n**Figure 2. 3. Realised volatility properties** \n\n Volatility Density \n\nSource: Kaiko and OECD calculations. \n\nThe OLS regression model is specified as follows: \n\n ( 2 ) log ( Vol \n\n t+ 1 \n\n ) = β \n\n 0 \n\n + β \n\n 1 \n\n log (LIQ \n\n t \n\n ) + β \n\n 2 \n\n log (Vol \n\n t \n\n ) + β \n\n 3 \n\n 𝑅 \n\n 𝑡 \n\n + β \n\n 4 \n\n 𝐼 \n\n 𝑡 \n\n + β \n\n 5 \n\n 𝑅 \n\n 𝑡 \n\n × 𝐼 \n\n 𝑡 \n\n + ε \n\n t+ 1 \n\nWhere, 𝑉𝑜𝑙 𝑡+ 1 \n\n- Realised volatility measured per equation 1 \n\n 𝐿𝐼𝑄 \n\n 𝑡 \n\n- the amount of USDC debt, evaluated in USD millions, that was liquidated between time 𝑡 − \n\n 1 and 𝑡 (two hours), summed across all protocols in the sample. \n\n 𝑉𝑜𝑙 \n\n 𝑡 \n\n- Realised volatility measured per equation 1 from time 𝑡 − 1 up to 𝑡 \n\n 𝑅 \n\n 𝑡 \n\n- return over the previous two hours, from 𝑃 \n\n 𝑡− 1 \n\n to 𝑃 \n\n 𝑡 \n\n . \n\n 𝐼 \n\n 𝑡 \n\n- dummy equal to 1 if 𝑅 \n\n 𝑡 \n\n has a positive value. \n\nFigure 2. 4 allows to get preliminary findings about the relationship between volatility and liquidations by \n\nsimply plotting the values of the volatility and the liquidated amount. The plot seems to support the \n\nconjecture of a positive relation between volatility and liquidated amount, and also to justify our decision to \n\nuse a logarithmic transformation on both volatility and liquidated debt to better account for a linear \n\ndependence. According to the scatter plot, the link between volatility and liquidated debt amount seems to \n\nbe weakened in the presence of low levels of liquidated debt. \n\nThe main econometric challenge herein is to isolate the impact of liquidations among the array of factors \n\nthat may impact DEX volatility. Due to well-documented persistence in volatility in traditional equity markets \n\n(see for example (Patton and Sheppard, 2015 [16] \n\n )), we control for the expected level of volatility by \n\nintroducing the lagged value of the dependent variable as an explanatory variable. The purpose is to \n\nensure that the results are not driven by incidents of a higher overall level of volatility in the market. As a \n\nrobustness check, we introduce an additional lag of realised volatility in a separate regression to allow for \n\neven stronger persistence. We also control for the magnitude and direction of price change by introducing \n\nthe value of the return of USDC/WETH, as well as an interaction term between the return and a dummy \n\nthat takes the value one for positive return incidences. This has two main objectives: i) ensure that the \n\nresults are not driven by a decline in the price of WETH, as liquidations tend to increase under adverse \n\nmarket conditions, and ii) control for asymmetric pattern of volatility under bullish and hawkish market \n\nconditions. \n\n\n**Figure 2. 4. Volatility and liquidations scatter plot** \n\nSource: Kaiko and OECD calculations. \n\nWe suspect that at least a certain part of liquidations is performed using flash loans, where both the \n\nliquidation and swap transactions are carried out in the same block. Alternatively, we claim that liquidators \n\nthat do not use flash loans are nevertheless incentivised to quickly swap the asset they receive from the \n\nlending pool in exchange for repaying the under-collateralised debt (i.e. the collateral asset) to lock in their \n\nprofit. Both these scenarios imply that the swaps associated with liquidations happen at the same time or \n\nadjacent to the liquidation. Ideally, we would like to measure the effect of liquidations on the volatility \n\nmeasured on DEXs simultaneously to liquidations. However, a potential caveat with such specification of \n\nthe model would be the presence of endogeneity. For instance, DEX price volatility might affect the price \n\nreported through Oracles to the lending pools protocols contracts, inducing more liquidations. \n\n 7 \n\n We thus \n\nlook at volatility measured after liquidations have taken place, to avoid such econometrical challenge. \n\nHowever, in doing so, we might be accounting for the effect of consecutive liquidations on volatility as well. \n\nIndeed, liquidation waves (i.e. when many liquidations take place during a short period of time) are a \n\ncommon phenomenon, and maybe caused by a range of factors. Investors often take similar investment \n\nstrategies in crypto leveraged lending (see Section 1.2), and massive liquidations have a negative price \n\nimpact, that may reinforce liquidation volumes through Oracles (Lehar and Christine A. Parlour, 2022 [6] \n\n ). \n\nTable 2. 2 presents the summary statistics for the variables used for the regression. The model is estimated \n\nfor the entire set of observations, where all liquidations of USDC debt with collateral in ETH/WETH are \n\naccounted for. In addition, data is also subsampled, removing the lower 10 and 20 % of debt liquidations \n\nobservations in Panel B and C, respectively. The subsampling is performed given the indication in \n\nFigure 2. 4 that small amounts of liquidations are irrelevant for volatility. This is also supported by (Lehar \n\nand Christine A. Parlour, 2022 [6] \n\n ) who observe swaps and flash loans carried out by liquidators more often \n\nto execute large liquidations. The three panels differ in the distribution of liquidated amount and return – \n\nboth medians are higher the more the sample is reduced, moving from Panel A to B and then C. This \n\nmakes sense as the observations with the lowest amount of debt are removed. Larger liquidations coincide \n\nwith higher return, which is equivalent to a greater depreciation of WETH. Average and median measures \n\nof volatility seem similar across the three panels. \n\n7 \n\n A caveat to this is the fact that Oracles aggregate many markets where a given pair of crypto-assets is traded, \n\nincluding not only DEXs but also CEXs, and such oracles are oblivious to small price changes. \n\n\n**Table 2. 2.

Empirical findings and interpretation** \n\nThe regression results are reported in Table 2. 3. Column (1) presents the results from estimating equation \n\n(2) using OLS for the entire sample. In column (2) we use Panel B subsample and in column (3) Panel C \n\nsubsample is used. In column (4) we take under consideration a longer persistence in volatility by adding \n\ntwo additional lags of realised volatility as explanatory variables, estimated for Panel B. We calculate \n\nrobust standard errors to avoid a miss interpretation of coefficients significance due to heteroscedasticity \n\nin all estimates. \n\nThe results of the estimations support the hypothesis that liquidations have a positive and significant effect \n\non the price volatility of USDC – WETH in DEX pools. Because both the dependent variable and the \n\nindependent variable of interest have been logarithmically transformed, the coefficient of the liquidated \n\namount is interpreted as the percent increase in the dependent variable for every 1% increase in the \n\nindependent variable. This implies that the impact of a 1% increase in USD millions liquidated debt is \n\nassociated with 0.017% – 0.024% increase in volatility. Since liquidations are volatile and occasionally \n\ntake extremely high values, their impact in such instances on volatility might be very large. The highest \n\ncoefficient for liquidated amount is obtained in column (2) where the bottom 10% of liquidations have been \n\n\nremoved. This might indicate that the effect of the change in liquidations on volatility is irrelevant for small \n\nliquidations and that liquidators do not require swaps for such small liquidations, being able to use their \n\nown available capital, in contrast to large liquidation clusters. \n\n**Table 2. 3.

Liquidated debt_ in USD millions is the liquidated amount in the \n\n2 hours up to _t_ of USDC debt collateralised by WETH, evaluated at USD millions. _Log(Liquidated debt_ in USD millions) is the logarithmic \n\ntransformation of the liquidated amount in the 2 hours up to _t_ of USDC debt collateralised by WETH, evaluated at USD millions. _Log(Volatility(t))_ \n\nis the realised volatility measured 2 hours earlier. _Return_ is the return over the previous 2 hours, from P(t1 ) to P(t). _Dummy (Return> 0 )_ is a dummy \n\nvariable indication if Return has a positive sign. _Return(+)_ is equal to _Return_ under positive values and zero otherwise. In Panel A (column 1), \n\nall observations are used. In Panel B (columns 2) only observations with value of liquidations higher than the bottom 10% are considered. In \n\nPanel C (columns 3) only observations with value of liquidations higher than the bottom 20% are considered. Column 4 uses Panel B \n\nobservations with two additional lagged Log(Volatility) variables. T-statistics are presented in parentheses. ***, **, and * indicate statistical \n\nsignificance at the 1%, 5%, and 10% levels, respectively. The sample covers the period 1 December 2020 to 8 December 2022. \n\nSource: OECD calculations based on Kaiko data. \n\nAll other estimated coefficients in Table 2. 3 , except for the dummy of return, are highly significant and with \n\nthe expected signs. Previous period volatility is an important factor explaining the current level of volatility, \n\nas evident from the significance of the coefficient of realised volatility at time t and the high coefficient. \n\nAdditional lagged values of volatility as in column (4) add additional explanatory power to the model, but \n\ndo not alter the results overall. The accumulated effect of return (combining the coefficients on Return and \n\non Return(+)) is negative for negative return values and positive, and twice larger in magnitude, for positive \n\nreturn values, consistent with the asymmetric nature of volatility under bullish and adverse market \n\nconditions. As explained earlier, the return is positive when the value of WETH is depreciating, showing a \n\n\npositive and economically larger relationship between WETH depreciation and increasing volatility. Large \n\nnegative return is also associated with increased volatility but not as much as positive return of the same \n\nabsolute magnitude. The adjusted R \n\n 2 \n\n statistic is close to half in columns (1) to (3) and increases slightly in \n\ncolumn (4). Accounting for additional lags of volatility only incrementally ameliorates the explanatory power \n\nof the specification. One potentially important factor affecting price volatility in AMM type of DEXs is the \n\ndeposited amount in the liquidity pools, or in other words – the depth of the pool. Current data limitations \n\nare preventing from taking this under account. However, importantly, there is no obvious rationale to \n\nbelieve that deposited amount in liquidity pools is connected to liquidations in lending pools. This is \n\nbecause the economic incentive of depositors in lending pools and in liquidity pools are different. In the \n\nfirst case, profits depend on the demand for borrowing, while in the second case, profits depend on the \n\ndemand for trade. \n\n**Figure 2. 5. Residual analysis** \n\nResiduals versus fitted log(volatility) plots \n\nNote: Fitted values of the OLS regressions from Table 2. 3 are plotted on the x-axis, and y-y hat, the residuals, are plotted on the y-axis. \n\nSource: OECD calculations based on Kaiko data. \n\nFigure 2. 5 presents a visual analysis of the fitted linear model of volatility for the four specifications in \n\nTable 2. 4. \n\nThe results of the two-stage least square estimation support a positive relationship between liquidations \n\nand price volatility. The coefficient on the variable of interest is about half the size of the coefficient received \n\nin the OLS estimation. The results support the conjecture that an effect of liquidations on the price volatility \n\nis present. All other estimated coefficients in Table 2. 4 , except for the return dummy, are highly significant \n\nand with the expected signs, and similar in magnitude to the OLS coefficients in Table 2. 3. \n\n\nTable 2. 4. For the vast majority of observations and for the four models, the residuals seem randomly \n\nspread around the zero line, suggesting that the assumption that the relationship between the change in \n\nliquidations and the change in volatility is linear is reasonable. The residuals also roughly spread at equal \n\ndistance around the zero line, suggesting that there is no issue with heteroskedasticity. Nevertheless, we \n\nemployed robust standard errors for coefficient significance. In all four specifications, the linear model over\n\nestimates log-volatility for large values, with negatively biased residuals for high fitted values. However, \n\nthis result concerns a small number of observations. \n\n 8 \n\nThese empirical findings suggest that a link exists between DeFi debt liquidations and DEX prices in the \n\nstudied DeFi lending protocol pools. The existence of such effect implies that liquidations contribute to \n\nboost price volatility during periods of stress in the market with a stronger effect in the presence of massive \n\nliquidations. This supports the suggestion that DeFi may amplify the vulnerabilities of the system in which \n\nit operates such as operational fragilities, liquidity and maturity mismatches, leverage, and \n\ninterconnectedness (OECD, 2022[1]; FSB, 2023[17]). The direction of the trades by liquidators and their \n\ntiming are predictable and might attract other traders to trade against them. The increased volatility might \n\nalso disincentivise liquidators or require a greater discount from the pool on the price of the collateral to \n\nexecute liquidations. This relation between liquidations and volatility might have a deterring effect on \n\nliquidators to carry out liquidations in the presence of large price changes, and when many loans become \n\neligible for liquidation simultaneously, as the spot volatility might hinder their profits from carrying out the \n\nliquidations. Alternatively, they might demand or bid for the repayment of the debt with a price reflecting \n\nhigh discount from market price to compensate for the risk. \n\nA more general problem currently in the DeFi markets is that there are no last-resort measures in place. \n\nDeFi markets are subject to extreme events, perhaps more often than traditional finance, because leverage \n\nis not monitored and investors are able to leverage up quickly, pursuing the same strategy. In contrast, in \n\nthe traditional finance, limits are placed on leverage, lending utilisation rates (reserves for banks); and \n\ndiversification is encouraged. Ultimately, last resort measures exist in traditional financial markets, circuit \n\nbreakers being one example. \n\n**2.4. A 2SLS approach to estimating liquidations effect on volatility** \n\nTo test for an effect of liquidations on price volatility without raising concerns over endogeneity, the model \n\npostulated in equation (2) includes liquidations that occurred in the two-hours prior to the estimation of \n\nrealised volatility, which is done over the following two-hours, so that the time difference will ensure there \n\nis no reverse causality between volatility and liquidations that would have otherwise resulted in a biased \n\nestimation of the regression coefficients. \n\nThis section presents an alternative approach to tackle the possible simultaneity existing between price \n\nvolatility and liquidations using a two-stage least-square (2SLS) approach with an instrumental variable. A \n\nvalid instrumental variable, Z \n\n t \n\n , must specify two conditions: (1) It must show relatively high level of \n\ncorrelation with the explanatory variable of interest, LIQ t \n\n , and (2) Z \n\n t \n\n should not affect 𝑉𝑜𝑙 \n\n t \n\n directly, except \n\nthrough LIQ t \n\n. While the first condition can be tested for, and such test is performed further below, the \n\nsecond conditions cannot be directly tested and relies on theoretical justification. \n\nAn appropriate candidate for such an instrumental variable for liquidations could be the adjustable interest \n\nrate charged by lending protocols for USDC loans. Borrowing (and deposit) interest rate is expected to rise \n\n8 \n\n Q-Q plots indicate that residuals distribution for the four models deviates from the normal distribution at extreme low \n\nand high values. Normality tests also point to rejection of the null that the residuals are normally distributed. At the \n\nsame time, since the sample is quite large, the rejection by the tests is expected, yet is not a severe concern for \n\nparameter significance as t and F statistics have approximately t and F distributions for large sample sizes (Jeffrey M. \n\nWooldridge, 2012[26]). \n\n\namid scarce liquidity on the lending pool (see Sections 1.1, 1.2 and 3.2 below). A substantial increase in \n\nthe adjustable interest rates is expected to increase deposit inflows and trigger also repayments or \n\nliquidations, due to the increase in the value of existing loans. Because of such features of lending \n\nprotocols, the adjustable interest rate should be a good predictor of liquidations. In contrast, there should \n\nnot be a direct relation between spot price volatility and the adjustable interest rate. The borrowing interest \n\nrate at focus is set in each protocol and for each asset separately, depending on the available liquidity of \n\nthis asset in that pool. Figure 2. 6 displays the weighted (by value of the borrowing amount) average of \n\nUSDC adjustable borrowing rate, in logarithmic transformation, derived from transactions that took place \n\non the lending protocols covered by the data. Importantly, there is considerable amount of variation in the \n\nborrowing rate so that it might offer valuable information associated with the liquidations amount. \n\n**Figure 2. 6. USDC adjustable borrowing rate in lending protocols** \n\nNote: lending protocols include AAVE V1 and V2 and Compound. Rate is the weighted mean borrowing interest rate measured across protocols \n\noffering USDC lending, within every 2 hour interval. \n\nSource: OECD calculations based on Kaiko data. \n\nUnlike the interest rate of currencies in traditional finance, the DeFi adjustable borrowing or deposit rates \n\nare not associated with macroeconomic conditions. The focus of the analysis is on high frequency changes \n\nto interest rate and price so the argument of a long-term relation between interest rates and exchange \n\nrates, as exists in traditional financial markets (interest rates parity), is less likely to apply in this case. To \n\nreject concerns of a possible connection between the USDC-WETH price in DEXs and the adjustable \n\nborrowing rate, a correlation analysis between the borrowing interest rate in lending pools and the USDC\n\nWETH exchange rate was performed and was found to be zero. \n\nThe two-stage estimation model includes two equations. The first equation is used to estimate the \n\nrelationship between the instrumental variable, i.e. the borrowing rate in USDC pools, and the liquidations \n\namount. Control variables are also included. \n\n ( 3 ) log (LIQ \n\n t \n\n ) = 𝜋 \n\n 0 \n\n + 𝜋 \n\n 1 \n\n log (𝐵 \n\n t \n\n ) + 𝜋 \n\n 2 \n\n log (Vol \n\n t− 1 \n\n ) + 𝜋 \n\n 3 \n\n 𝑅 \n\n 𝑡− 1 \n\n + 𝜋 \n\n 4 \n\n 𝐼 \n\n 𝑡− 1 \n\n + 𝜋 \n\n 5 \n\n 𝑅 \n\n 𝑡− 1 \n\n × 𝐼 \n\n 𝑡− 1 \n\n + v \n\n t \n\nWhere 𝐿𝐼𝑄 𝑡 \n\n- is the endogenous variable, and is, as before, the liquidated amount during the 2 - hours from \n\n𝑡 − 1 up to 𝑡 of USDC debt collateralised by WETH, evaluated at USD millions. \n\n𝐵 t \n\n- is the instrumental variable, calculated as the weighted mean borrowing interest rate measured \n\nbetween time 𝑡 − 1 and 𝑡 across all borrow transactions of USDC in the pools in the sample data. \n\n\nVol \n\n t− 1 \n\n- is an exogenous variable in the second stage and is the realised volatility measured per equation \n\n(1) from time 𝑡 − 2 up to 𝑡 − 1 , and. \n\n𝑅 𝑡− 1 \n\n- is another exogenous variable in the second stage and is the USDC to WETH price return \n\nover 2 hours, from 𝑃 𝑡− 2 \n\n to 𝑃 \n\n 𝑡− 1 \n\n𝐼 𝑡− 1 \n\n- dummy equal to 1 if 𝑅 \n\n 𝑡− 1 \n\n has a positive value. \n\nThe liquidations and borrowing rate variables are taken from the same two-hour time interval in the 2SLS \n\nestimation, unlike in equation (2), where volatility from the next time interval after liquidations is used in the \n\nOLS estimation. \n\nIn the second stage, the price volatility is regressed on the predicted values of the endogenous regressor, \n\nlog(𝐿𝐼𝑄 \n\n 𝑡 \n\n ̂ \n\n ) and all other exogenous variables using OLS, with a similar specification as in equitation 2. The \n\nmain difference from equation (2) it that in this specification, the volatility and liquidations are both \n\nestimated for the same time interval, from 𝑡 − 1 to 𝑡. \n\n ( 4 \n\n ) log (Vol \n\n t \n\n ) = 𝛾 \n\n 0 \n\n + 𝛾 \n\n 1 \n\n log(𝐿𝐼𝑄 \n\n 𝑡 \n\n ̂ \n\n ) + 𝛾 \n\n 2 \n\n log (Vol \n\n t− 1 \n\n ) + 𝛾 \n\n 3 \n\n 𝑅 \n\n 𝑡− 1 \n\n + 𝛾 \n\n 4 \n\n 𝐼 \n\n 𝑡− 1 \n\n + 𝛾 \n\n 5 \n\n 𝑅 \n\n 𝑡− 1 \n\n × 𝐼 \n\n 𝑡− 1 \n\n + 𝑢 \n\n t \n\nThe measured correlation between the logarithm of liquidated debt amount and logarithm of USDC \n\nborrowing rate is 0. 37 , significant at a 5% level. To assess whether the chosen instrument is a valid \n\ninstrument, its ability to explain variability in the endogenous variable should be examined. To verify this, \n\nthe F-statistic is computed from the first stage of the 2SLS regression (equation (3)) corresponding to the \n\nhypothesis that the coefficient of the instrumental variable, log (𝐵 t \n\n ), is zero. The resulting F-statistic is \n\n62. 04 , which is sufficiently high to reinforce the choice of the borrowing rate as the instrumental variable. \n\nResults of the second stage estimation, which display the estimator of the coefficient of interest, i.e. 𝛾 \n\n 1 \n\nfrom equation (4), are presented Table 2. 4. \n\n 9 \n\nThe results of the two-stage least square estimation support a positive relationship between liquidations \n\nand price volatility. The coefficient on the variable of interest is about half the size of the coefficient received \n\nin the OLS estimation. The results support the conjecture that an effect of liquidations on the price volatility \n\nis present. All other estimated coefficients in Table 2. 4 , except for the return dummy, are highly significant \n\nand with the expected signs, and similar in magnitude to the OLS coefficients in Table 2. 3. \n\n9 \n\n The estimation of the 2SLS model was performed using the function ivreg() from the package “ivreg” in R. \n\n\n**Table 2. 4. 2SLS regression results** \n\n Dependent Variable \n\n log (Realised Volatility (t+1)) \n\n Log (liquidated debt in \n\n USD millions) \n\n 0.112 \n\n *** \n\n (0.018) \n\n Log (Volatility (t-1)) 0.365 \n\n *** \n\n (0.048) \n\n Return 5.706 \n\n ** \n\n (2.476) \n\n Dummy (Return>0) 0.003 \n\n (0.042) \n\n Return (+) 8.835 \n\n *** \n\n (2.792) \n\n Constant 1.823 \n\n *** \n\n (0.139) \n\n Robust standard \n\n errors \n\n Yes \n\n Observations 1 , 317 \n\n R \n\n 2 \n\n 0.231 \n\n Adjusted R \n\n 2 \n\n 0.228 \n\n Residual Std.

Alternative measure of realised volatility** \n\nIn the OLS and 2SLS specifications, realised volatility was measured over a two-hour horizon using \n\none-minute returns. In accordance, liquidations were aggregated by their value over matching two-hour \n\ntime intervals. The frequency of price sampling should not be shorter than one minute because this \n\nfrequency well reflects the frequency of trades on DEXs in the data where USDC-WETH pair is available, \n\nand no more than a few trades occur in a minute on average. One-minute price sampling allows for volatility \n\ncomputation over shorter as well as longer than two-hour time horizons. Because the flow of information \n\nin the DeFi space is probably fast and there is much use of automation, choosing a longer time horizon for \n\nestimation, such as a 2 4 hours window, will likely include many additional influences on top of the \n\nliquidations in DeFi lending protocols. It would be hard to justify any econometric result as pointing to a \n\ndirect link between liquidations and volatility. Alternatively, a shorter time horizon can be assessed, and \n\nthat is the test performed in this section. The time horizon chosen for the additional robustness check is \n\nthat of 3 0 minutes. The intervals between price samplings are as before one minute. \n\n\nFrom the aggregated price of USDC-WETH sampled in one-minute intervals we produce continuously \n\ncompound returns by taking the difference of the natural logarithm of the price series. Realised volatility is \n\nthen measured as the square root of the average variance of returns, assuming the return has a zero\n\nmean. Specifically, volatility is measured as follows: \n\n ( 4 ) 𝑉𝑜𝑙 \n\n 𝑡+ 1 \n\n = \n\n √ ∑ 𝑟 \n\n 𝑡+𝑘 \n\n 2 \n\n 𝑡+ 1 \n\n 𝑘= 0 \n\nWhere 𝑟 𝑡+𝑘 \n\n is the logarithmic (continuously compounded) return of the price of USDC versus WETH \n\nmeasured each k interval (one-minute), from time 𝑡 and until 30 minutes later denoted by 𝑡 + 1. Each \n\nvolatility estimation is thus based on 30 return observations. Figure 2. 7 portrays the characteristics of the \n\nUSDC-WETH price volatility measured over 30 minutes horizons. Compared with the longer horizon \n\nvolatility in Figure 2. 3 , the majority of values are lower, as can be expected, making the extreme values in \n\ncertain periods to appear even more extreme. \n\n**Figure 2. 7.

As before, column ( 1 ) presents the \n\nresults from estimating equation ( 2 ) with volatility and liquidations measured over a 3 0 minutes time \n\nhorizon, using OLS, for the entire sample. In column ( 2 ) we use Panel B sub-sample and in column \n\n( 3 ) Panel C sub-sample is used. In column ( 4 ) we allow for a longer persistence in volatility by adding two \n\nadditional lags of realised volatility as explanatory variables, estimated for Panel B. We calculate robust \n\nstandard errors to avoid a miss interpretation of coefficients significance due to heteroscedasticity in all \n\nestimates. Results are generally similar to the findings of the base line estimation in Section 2.3 and \n\nsupport the hypothesis that liquidations have a positive and significant effect on the price volatility of USDC \n\n- WETH in DEX pools, for shorter horizon volatility. The coefficients of the liquidated amount, interpreted \n\nas the percent increase in the dependent variable for every 1% increase in the independent variable, are \n\nabout twice the magnitude compared with the base line specification in Table 2. 4. This might be interpreted \n\nas indicating that trade associated with liquidations takes place mostly right after liquidations and has in \n\nparticular a short time effect on volatility that afterwards gradually decreases. All other estimated \n\ncoefficients, except for the dummy on return, are highly significant. The coefficient on previous period \n\nvolatility has similar magnitude as in the base line regression; the coefficient of the return, and the positive \n\nreturn, have larger coefficients than in the baseline regression and the same signs, demonstrating once \n\nmore the asymmetric reaction of volatility to negative and positive returns. \n\n\n**Table 2. 6.

Liquidation mechanisms in DeFi** \n\nLiquidity supplied to DeFi lending pools is available to be borrowed by participants. DeFi Borrowing is \n\nmostly used to create a leveraged position in volatile crypto assets. To reduce the credit risk of borrowers, \n\nall loans are performed with over-collateralisation, i.e. the borrower must supply a collateral with an initial \n\nvalue greater than the loan. When the loan becomes under-collateralised, liquidators can repay the debt \n\nand gain the collateral at a discounted price. Platforms use the deposit and borrowing interest rates to \n\nmaintain an equilibrium in the pool, so that there will remain enough liquidity. A high interest rate reduces \n\nthe appeal of borrowing, and at the same time, increases the value of existing loans, invoking more \n\nliquidations and increasing liquidity in the pool. \n\nIn theory, if many depositors decide to withdraw at the same time, the protocol will be unable to provide \n\nsuch demand if much of the deposited amount has been borrowed. In different calibrations, lending pools \n\nuse a mechanism of adjustable interest rate and liquidations to avoid this situation. If liquidity in a certain \n\npool becomes low, the borrowing rate will rise, and this will encourage borrowers to repay, or push their \n\nposition to become under-collateralised, which will induce liquidators to restore liquidity through the \n\nrepayment of under-collateralised loans. In parallel, interest rate on deposits will rise, motivating more \n\ndeposits. \n\nA good example for how interest rate can be set effectively presented by Aave; the interest rate charged \n\nto borrowers follows a two-step function; the function is split according to an optimal _utilisation rate_ set by \n\nAave, individually to each token. Optimal utilisation rates (borrowed relative to deposited amount) vary \n\naround 80% for liquid “stablecoins” and, 65% for ETH and BTC, and 45% for other low liquidity crypto \n\nassets. If the utilisation rate surpasses the optimal utilisation rate specified by the protocol, the interest rate \n\nincreases sharply. Surpassing the optimal utilisation rate does not necessarily imply that borrowing is \n\nhalted; rather the variable interest rate mechanism is expected to incentivise users to act so that the pool \n\nremains below full utilisation (AAVE, 2023[18]). \n\nThe uncertainty related to this expectation is whether sufficient external liquidity exists to help restore the \n\nliquidity in the pool. What if borrowers locked the borrowed asset at a staking pool and are unable to repay? \n\nIn parallel, there might not be enough free float of the asset that can be deposited despite the attractive \n\ninterest rate. The liquidations mechanism is the back stop to restore liquidity in the absence of external \n\nflows of assets coming from outside the pools (e.g. from centralised exchanges, from cold wallets). \n\nLiquidators are thus required to possess the asset that will be used to repay the under-collateralised debt. \n\nThis section shows that liquidators depend on external liquidity as well, including lending pools’ liquidity \n\nwhich they are expected to restore, to repay the debt. \n\nThe case of the Curve Dao Tokens (CRV) exploit attempt in November 2022 illustrates the effect that low \n\nmarket depth may have on the ability to liquidate under-collateralised debt. The exploit attempt began with \n\na user that borrowed tens of millions of CRV tokens from the Aave platform, allegedly with the attempt to \n\nlater drive the price of CRV down by quickly selling it on exchanges, targeting another user that at that \n\ntime was supplying the CRV liquidity to Aave. However, the price of CRV in fact spiked due to a short \n\nsqueeze, and the position of the borrower became under-collateralised. Presumably, because of the \n\nrelative low liquidity of CRV, Aave was left with 2.64mn CRV tokens, worth more than USD 1. 5 million at \n\n\nthat time, in bad debt, that was neither liquidated nor ever repaid (Carey and Melachrinos, 2022[3]). In \n\nJanuary 2023 the Aave governing community decided to eliminate the bad debt of 2. 7 million of CRV \n\n(CoinDesk, 2023[19]). \n\nTo carry out liquidations, the liquidators need to repay the loan. They can perform this from their available \n\ncapital, with borrowed funds/assets, or in the form of a flash loan. Flash loans are uncollateralised loans \n\nwhere the borrowing and the repayment of the loan are registered within the same block on the chain \n\n(OECD, 2022[1]). Importantly, a flash loan cannot be performed without liquidity in the pool from which it is \n\ntaken, even though it is repaid at the same block and there is no default risk involved. Flash loans have \n\nalso been used to attack DeFi protocols and not all lending or exchange liquidity pools offer this type of \n\ndebt. (Lehar and Christine A. Parlour, 2022[6]) decompose the use of capital, swaps and flash loans by \n\nliquidators. They find that flash loans are used rarely, while capital is most often used, though the use of \n\nswaps is significant when liquidations are large. (Lehar and Christine A. Parlour, 2022[6]) do mention that \n\nthey might be underestimating the use of swaps. The empirical results in Section 2 support the conjecture \n\nthat liquidators indeed swap post liquidations. (Qin et al., 2021[4]) show that at least 5% of liquidations in \n\ntheir sample made in Aave and Compound during 2019 21 were made with flash loans taken from Aave \n\nand dXdY pools. \n\nPoor liquidity management has been associated with many of the 2022 contagion crises in the crypto \n\necosystem (Conor Ryder, 2022[20]). For many crypto assets, a significant discrepancy exists between the \n\nasset’s market capitalisation value and liquidity parameters such as trading volumes, market depth and \n\nbid-ask spreads (Conor Ryder, 2022[20]). \n\nThe low levels of ETH/WETH liquidity in lending pools reached around the date of the Merge, \n\n 10 \n\n a one-off \n\nexceptional conjuncture may provide some insights into crises situations that may affect liquidity conditions \n\nin DeFi lending pools. The two most liquid crypto assets are BTC and ETH. Their liquidity ranking is at the \n\ntop on all parameters including market cap and trading parameters, with some gap in their favour compared \n\nto the third place (Conor Ryder, 2022[20]). High utilisation rates of ETH/WETH were reached across lending \n\npools around the event of the Merge. Intensive borrowing of ETH/WETH, followed by withdraws of deposits \n\nled to borrowed amounts surpassing deposited amounts (disregarding accrued interest) around the 14th \n\nof September in Aave V2 pool (Figure 3. 1 ). Daily balance data from Chainalysis, which is of lower \n\nfrequency than the event data from Kaiko, confirms the drop in available liquidity of WETH in Aave V2 and \n\na low level of available liquidity of ETH in Compound reached in mid-September (Figure 3. 2 ). Though \n\nborrowing was halted by the Aave protocol, \n\n 11 \n\n withdrawals worsened the liquidity situation in the pool. At \n\nthis point interest rate for borrowers and depositors spiked to attract liquidity. The borrowed amount then \n\nstarted to decline as users repaid their loans. \n\n10 \n\n The Merge is the name commonly given to the event when the original execution layer of Ethereum, Mainnet, was \n\njoined with its new proof-of-stake consensus layer. Since then, validation on the Ethereum network is only done \n\nthrough proof-of-stake consensus and by proof-of-work mining. \n\n11 \n\n As a pre-emptive step, Aave community voted between 30 August, 2022, and 2 September, 2022, to pause ETH \n\nlending to protect the protocol from risks associated with excessive borrowing. “High utilisation interferes with \n\nliquidation transactions, thus increasing the chances of insolvency for the protocol,” Block Analitica said in the proposal. \n\nBut not only the ability to carry out liquidations is at risk, but also the repayment to depositors \n\n\n**Figure 3. 1. Assets and obligations on ETH liquidity pool on Aave V2** \n\nContinuous representation of assets and obligations on the pool \n\nNote: Balance sheet is presented as is custom for banks: assets represent loans and obligations represent deposits. Balance data is \n\napproximated by accounting for net flows since the launch of Aave V2 in December 2020. Assets are calculated as loans outflow net of \n\nrepayments and liquidations; obligations include inflow of deposits net of withdraws and liquidated collateral. \n\nSource: Kaiko and OECD calculations. \n\n**Figure 3. 2. Balances of Aave V2 and Compound** \n\nDaily balance of ETH/WETH in leading lending pools \n\nNote: Daily balances of Aave V2 interest bearing wETH and of Compound Ether (cETH) for ETH. \n\nSource: Chainalysis Market Intel. \n\nAs the interest rate in Compound directly accrues to the balance, it is difficult to calculate the balance on \n\nCompound through netting of the flows. The level of the interest rate charged to borrowers or paid to \n\ndepositors can indirectly reveal the liquidity condition of the ETH pool in Compound and Aave V1. Indeed, \n\ninterest rates for ETH on Compound spiked around the merge, indicating liquidity was scarce in Compound \n\nas well. Compound took some measures to limit ETH borrowing in the days before the Merge, including a \n\n 0 \n\n 200 \n\n 400 \n\n 600 \n\n 800 \n\n 1000 \n\n Aave V2 Compound \n\n\ncap on borrowing amount and higher interest rate for large borrowings (CoinDesk, 2022[21]). Data shows \n\nthat interest rate on ETH lending in Aave V1 also spiked around that time. \n\n**Figure 3. 3. Rate on borrowing ETH/WETH from leading lending protocols** \n\nSource: Kaiko and OECD calculations. \n\nWhat is more, a very small number of liquidations of debt denominated in ETH were performed around the \n\nMerge, although that event was an exceptional circumstance that does not reflect normal conditions. The \n\ndata does not allow a direct observation of the health factors or collateral factor of loans, but it is reasonable \n\nto assume that the high borrowing rates reached at that point across pools would have affected many \n\nborrowing positions to become under-collateralised. Despite this conjecture, the amount and value of \n\nliquidations of ETH denominated debt in Compound V2, Aave V1 and V2 pools were very low around this \n\nevent in mid-September 2022. The low level of liquidations related to the case of the Merge might be partly \n\ndriven by liquidity constrains faced by liquidators. \n\n\n**Figure 3. 4. Liquidations of debt denominated in ETH** \n\n Total liquidations (in number of liquidations) \n\n Total liquidations (in amount of debt liquidated) \n\nSource: Kaiko and OECD calculations. \n\nAlthough the event of the Merge and the behaviour of users trying to profit from it is an extreme event, as \n\nthis is the only event in the sample that have resulted in such high interest rates for borrowing and \n\ndepositing ETH, it demonstrates the “herd” behaviour that is typical of the crypto asset ecosystem in its \n\ncurrent stage of development. This leads to the problem of unbalanced markets where all investors are \n\npursuing either a long or a short position at the same time, with no balancing interest on the other side, \n\nexcept for arbitrageurs. \n\n\n**3.2. Positive correlation among borrowing rates in examined DeFi lending** \n\n**protocols** \n\nThe phenomenon of positive correlation among borrowing rates across the examined DeFi lending pools \n\nis not unique to ETH, and it is even more prominent for stablecoins such as USDT and USDC. A correlation \n\nanalysis on the adjustable lending rates received by borrowers in actual transactions in the sample used \n\nshows that correlation for the borrowing of such stablecoins is positive and significant for the three largest \n\npools in the sample. Data frequency is hourly with rates being averaged over the transactions performed \n\nduring an hour. \n\n**Figure 3. 5. Correlation analysis of interest rates charged to USDC and USDT borrows in different** \n\n**pools** \n\nInterest rates are based on actual transactions data, measured as the average of an hour of transactions in different \n\npools \n\n USDC borrowing rates USDT borrowing rates \n\nNote: Right figure represents borrowing rates of USDC. Left figure is for USDT. The colour of the numeric value corresponds to the legend. All \n\nreported values are significant at 1%. \n\nSource: Kaiko and OECD calculations. \n\nThe interest rate analysis and the case study around the event of the Merge point to the fact that liquidity \n\ntends to move in the same direction across lending pools. Lending pools can and have before reached \n\nmaximal utilisation rates, especially for less common assets (AAVE, 2023[22]; intotheblock, 2023[23]) and \n\neven the most liquid assets, such as ETH, can reach 100% utilisation rate, as was shown, in extreme \n\nevents. This analysis and anecdotal evidence suggest liquidators can face liquidity constrains in certain \n\nextreme events or when liquidations are required for less commonly traded assets. \n\n\n## References \n\n AAVE (2023), Borrow Interest Rate Risk , https://docs.aave.com/risk/v/aave-v2/liquidity\n\n risk/borrow-interest-rate (accessed on 22 March 2023). \n\n [18] \n\n AAVE (2023), Historical Utilisation Risk , https://docs.aave.com/risk/v/aave-v2/liquidity\n\n risk/historical-utilization (accessed on 22 March 2023). \n\n [22] \n\n Ben-David, I., F.

            "Proof of Liquidity Integration Guide for Non-ERC20 Protocols | Berachain Core Docs  \n\n# Proof of Liquidity Integration Guide for Non-ERC20 Protocols\n\n## Introduction\n\nUsers typically engage with Proof of Liquidity by staking ERC20 receipt tokens into Reward Vaults to earn ``$BGT``. However, this approach may not be suitable for all protocols.\n\nThis guide demonstrates how to integrate Berachain's Proof of Liquidity (PoL) system for protocols who don't naturally produce stakeable ERC20 receipt tokens or otherwise need to track balances internally. For example, a perpetual futures exchange may wish to reward users who open trading positions with ``$BGT``, and cease rewards when the position is closed.\n\nBy implementing this approach, such protocols can still participate in PoL, benefiting from the improved incentive efficiencies it provides.\n\nWARNING\n\nNote that this article provides only one possible workaround for integrating PoL with non-ERC20 protocols. The solution is not exhaustive and may not be suitable for all use cases.\n\n## Description of Approach\n\nThe described approach involves the creation of a dummy `StakingToken` that is staked in a PoL vault on behalf of users by a protocol. This dummy token is used to track the staked balances of users and is minted and burned by the protocol (operating through `ProtocolContract`) as users provide/withdraw their liquidity from the protocol.\n\nThe staked dummy token balance entitles users to earn ``$BGT`` as if they had staked an ERC20 receipt token in a PoL vault themselves. This approach is enabled by the `delegateStake` and `delegateWithdraw` methods in the RewardVault contract.\n\n## Requirements\n\nBefore beginning, make sure you have Foundry installed beforehand.\n\n- Foundry\n\n## Project Setup\n\n1. Initialize a new Forge project and install dependencies:\n\n```bash\nforge init pol-smart-stake --no-commit --no-git;\ncd pol-smart-stake;\nforge install OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts --no-commit --no-git;\n```\n\n2. Create a `remappings.txt` file for OpenZeppelin imports:\n\n\n```bash\n# FROM: ./pol-smart-stake\n\necho \"@openzeppelin/contracts/=lib/openzeppelin-contracts/contracts/\" > remappings.txt;\n```\n\n## Implement Contracts\n\n#### 1\\. Create the dummy token contract at `src/StakingToken.sol`\n\n```solidity\n// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT\npragma solidity ^0.8.19;\n\nimport \"@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC20/ERC20.sol\";\nimport \"@openzeppelin/contracts/access/Ownable.sol\";\n\ncontract StakingToken is ERC20, Ownable {\n    constructor() ERC20(\"StakingToken\", \"STK\") Ownable(msg.sender) {}\n\n    function mint(address to, uint256 amount) external onlyOwner {\n        _mint(to, amount);\n    }\n\n    function burn(address from, uint256 amount) external onlyOwner {\n        _burn(from, amount);\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThis contract creates a dummy ERC20 token that will be used for staking in PoL vaults. Only the owner (`ProtocolContract`) can mint and burn tokens.\n\n#### 2\\. Create a mock protocol contract at `src/ProtocolContract.sol`\n\n\n```solidity\n// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT\npragma solidity ^0.8.19;\n\nimport \"./StakingToken.sol\";\nimport {IBerachainRewardsVault, IBerachainRewardsVaultFactory} from \"./interfaces/IRewardVaults.sol\";\n\ncontract ProtocolContract {\n    StakingToken public stakingToken;\n    IBerachainRewardsVault public rewardVault;\n\n    mapping(address => uint256) public userActivity;\n\n    constructor(address _vaultFactory) {\n        // Create new staking token\n        stakingToken = new StakingToken();\n\n        // Create vault for newly created token\n        address vaultAddress = IBerachainRewardsVaultFactory(_vaultFactory)\n            .createRewardsVault(address(stakingToken));\n\n        rewardVault = IBerachainRewardsVault(vaultAddress);\n    }\n\n    function addActivity(address user, uint256 amount) external {\n        // Protocol actions/logic here\n        userActivity[user] += amount;\n\n        // Mint StakingTokens\n        stakingToken.mint(address(this), amount);\n\n        // Stake tokens in RewardVault on behalf of user\n        stakingToken.approve(address(rewardVault), amount);\n        rewardVault.delegateStake(user, amount);\n    }\n\n    function removeActivity(address user, uint256 amount) external {\n        // Protocol actions/logic here\n        require(userActivity[user] > = amount, \"Insufficient user activity\");\n        userActivity[user] -= amount;\n\n        // Withdraw tokens from the RewardVault\n        rewardVault.delegateWithdraw(user, amount);\n\n        // Burn the withdrawn StakingTokens\n        stakingToken.burn(address(this), amount);\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThis contract is a simple representation of an arbitrary protocol's contract:\n\n- `userActivity` represents the internal accounting and logic specific to that protocol\n\n- The remainder of the `addActivity` and `removeActivity` methods mint and burn `StakingTokens`, and interacts with the relevant RewardVault to stake/unstake on behalf of users\n\n#### 3\\. Add the PoL Interfaces at `src/interfaces/IRewardVaults.sol`\n\n```solidity\npragma solidity ^0.8.19;\n\ninterface IBerachainRewardsVault {\n    function delegateStake(address account, uint256 amount) external;\n\n    function delegateWithdraw(address account, uint256 amount) external;\n\n    function getTotalDelegateStaked(\n        address account\n    ) external view returns (uint256);\n\n    function balanceOf(address account) external returns (uint256);\n}\n\ninterface IBerachainRewardsVaultFactory {\n    function createRewardsVault(\n        address stakingToken\n    ) external returns (address);\n}\n```\n\nThese interfaces define the methods for spinning up a new RewardVault from the Factory contract, and for subsequently interacting with it.\n\n## Testing the Integration\n\nNow, we wire everything together with tests to ensure that the integration works as expected. Below is an example test suite for the `ProtocolContract` contract.\n\nFeel free to look at each individual test to get a better idea on how successful scenarios are handled.\n\n``` solidity\n\n// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT\npragma solidity ^0.8.19;\n\nimport \"forge-std/Test.sol\";\nimport \"../src/ProtocolContract.sol\";\nimport {IBerachainRewardsVault, IBerachainRewardsVaultFactory} from \"../src/interfaces/IRewardVaults.sol\";\n\ncontract ProtocolContractTest is Test {\n    ProtocolContract public protocol;\n    IBerachainRewardsVault public rewardVault;\n\n    address public user1 = address(0x1);\n    address public user2 = address(0x2);\n\n    function setUp() public {\n        IBerachainRewardsVaultFactory vaultFactory = IBerachainRewardsVaultFactory(\n                0x2B6e40f65D82A0cB98795bC7587a71bfa49fBB2B\n            );\n        protocol = new ProtocolContract(address(vaultFactory));\n        rewardVault = protocol.rewardVault();\n    }\n\n    function testAddActivity() public {\n        protocol.addActivity(user1, 1);\n        assertEq(protocol.userActivity(user1), 1);\n        assertEq(rewardVault.balanceOf(user1), 1);\n    }\n\n    function testRemoveActivity() public {\n        protocol.addActivity(user1, 2);\n        protocol.removeActivity(user1, 1);\n        assertEq(protocol.userActivity(user1), 1);\n        assertEq(rewardVault.balanceOf(user1), 1);\n    }\n\n    function testMultipleUsers() public {\n        protocol.addActivity(user1, 1);\n        protocol.addActivity(user2, 2);\n        assertEq(rewardVault.balanceOf(user1), 1);\n        assertEq(rewardVault.balanceOf(user2), 2);\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Run the Test\n\nFinally, we run the test to check that the integration works as expected:\n\n``` bash\n# FROM: ./pol-smart-stake\n\nforge test --rpc-url https://bartio.rpc.berachain.com/;\n\n# [Expected Output]:\n# [⠊] Compiling...x\n# No files changed, compilation skipped\n# Ran 3 tests for test/StakingToken.t.sol:ProtocolContractTest\n# [PASS] testAddActivity() (gas: 252067)\n# [PASS] testMultipleUsers() (gas: 371503)\n# [PASS] testRemoveActivity() (gas: 272693)\n# Suite result: ok. 3 passed; 0 failed; 0 skipped; finished in 1.73s (1.22ms CPU time)\n```\n",

            "Berachain Governance | Berachain Core Docs  \n\n# Berachain Governance \n\nBerachain's Governance system uses ``$BGT`` to allow token holders to make important decisions about core functions of Proof of Liquidity & our core dapps. Here's a few examples of what governance can be used for:\n\n-   PoL asset whitelisting (e.g., new staking assets, whitelisting incentive assets)\n\n-   ``$HONEY`` minting parameters (e.g., eligible collateral assets, minting rates)\n\n-   Native dApp governance (e.g., changes to Bend's interest rate model)\n\n    -   Berps\n\n    -   Bend\n\n    -   Bex\n\n-   Whitelisting Rewards Vaults for ``$BGT`` emissions\n\n## Governance Process \n\nThe governance process on Berachain follows several stages:\n\n1.  **Proposal Creation**: Any user with sufficient voting power can create a governance proposal.\n\n2.  **Pending State**: Once created, the proposal enters a waiting period before becoming active for voting.\n\n3.  **Active Voting**: During the voting period, ``$BGT`` holders can cast their votes.\n\n4.  **Proposal Outcome**: After the voting period, the proposal is either marked as Succeeded or Defeated. A quorum of ``$BGT`` is required for a proposal to pass.\n\n5.  **Timelock**: If the proposal succeeds, it enters a queue with a timelock delay.\n\n6.  **Execution**: After the timelock period, the proposal can be executed, implementing the proposed changes.\n\n## Creating a Governance Proposal \n\nTo create a governance proposal on Berachain:\n\n1.  **Ensure Sufficient Voting Power**: You need sufficient ``$BGT``, either owned directly or delegated to you by other token holders.\n\n2.  **Delegate ``$BGT``**: Even if you own the required ``$BGT``, you must delegate it to yourself (or have it delegated by others) to gain voting power.\n\n3.  **Prepare Your Proposal**: Clearly define the changes you want to implement. For example, to add a Reward Vault to the BeraChef contract, you would need to specify the vault address and the function call to update the \"friends of the chef.\"\n\n4.  **Submit the Proposal**: Use the governance contract to submit your proposal on-chain. This typically involves calling a `propose` function with the necessary parameters.\n\n5.  **Monitor and Participate**: Once submitted, monitor your proposal's progress through the various stages. Encourage other ``$BGT`` holders to vote and participate in discussions about your proposal.\n\n6.  **Execute if Passed**: If your proposal passes and completes the timelock period, you or another user can execute it to implement the changes.\n\nFor a detailed walkthrough of creating a governance proposal, including code examples and step-by-step instructions, please refer to our full tutorial.\n\n## Testnet Governance Values \n\nFor the current testnet, the following values apply:\n\nWARNING\n\n**NOTE:** These values are specific to the testnet and may change for the mainnet launch.

This process is facilitated through Reward Vaults, which play a crucial role in the governance and incentive structure of the Berachain ecosystem.\n\n## Understanding Reward Vaults in PoL \n\nReward Vaults are smart contracts that enable validators to share their ``$BGT`` rewards with protocols. When validators build blocks, they earn ``$BGT`` proportional to their staked amount. Validators can then:\n\n1.  Use ``$BGT`` for governance participation\n\n2.  Exchange ``$BGT`` for ``$BERA`` (the native gas token)\n\n3.  Share ``$BGT`` rewards with protocols through Reward Vaults\n\nThis mechanism is central to Berachain's Reward Vaults system.\n\n## Governance and Reward Vaults \n\nWhile creating a Reward Vault is permissionless, for it to receive ``$BGT`` emissions from validators, it must be whitelisted through a governance proposal. This process ensures community oversight and alignment with the PoL system's goals.\n\n### Governance Process for Whitelisting \n\n1.  **Meet ``$BGT`` Requirements**:\n\n    -   A minimum amount of ``$BGT`` is needed to create a proposal\n\n    -   ``$BGT`` can be acquired through participation in PoL on native dApps\n\n2.  **Create and Submit Proposal**:\n\n    -   Proposals are submitted on-chain\n\n    -   There's a waiting period before voting begins\n\n3.  **Voting Period**:\n\n    -   Active voting window\n\n    -   ``$BGT`` holders cast votes (quorum required)\n\n4.  **Proposal Outcome**:\n\n    -   If passed: Enters a timelock queue\n\n    -   If declined: Marked as defeated, allowing for a new proposal after addressing concerns\n\n> **NOTE:** For specific testnet values such as required `$BGT` amounts, voting periods, and quorum requirements, please refer to the Governance Overview section.\n\n## Impact on the PoL Ecosystem \n\nWhitelisting a Reward Vault through governance has significant implications:\n\n1.  **Liquidity Incentives**: Approved vaults can receive ``$BGT`` emissions, incentivizing liquidity provision.\n\n2.  **Protocol Growth**: Protocols can use accumulated ``$BGT`` to bootstrap liquidity or participate in governance.\n\n3.  **Ecosystem Alignment**: The governance process ensures that whitelisted vaults align with the community's interests.\n\nYou can read more about Reward Vaults in our Reward Vaults section.\n\nFor more information on Berachain's governance system, see the Governance Overview.\n\nLearn more about creating a governance proposal for Berachain Reward Vaults",
            "Berachain Frequently Asked Questions ❓ | Berachain Core Docs  \n\n# Berachain Frequently Asked Questions ❓ \n## What do Berachain's performance metrics look like? \n\nBerachain has the following properties:\n\n-   Block time: Block times varies, for latest feel free to check it out at Beratrail Block Explorer.\n\n-   Transactions per Second (TPS): This can vary but the following should help with the number of possible transactions (Block gas limit (30m) / Average gas limit per txn) / Block time (2s) = TPS.\n\n-   Finality: Instant finality\n\n## What is a DEX? \n\nDEX stands for Decentralized Exchange. It is a place where you can buy and sell tokens that lives directly on the chain instead of being run by any one centralized service. This means that all liquidity can be seen directly on-chain, and is verifiably owned by the smart contracts themselves. A DEX enables you to swap tokens directly from your wallet, as well as allowing anyone to launch their own tokens and provide liquidity.\n\n## What is a swap? \n\nA swap is the process of exchanging one token for another. This can be thought of as a buy or a sell, depending on which token you're looking at. For example, if you're looking to buy ``$BERA`` with ``$ETH``, you would be swapping ``$ETH`` for ``$BERA``. This is essentially \"selling\" ``$ETH`` and \"buying\" $`$BERA`.\n\n## How much does it cost to swap? \n\nEach swap has a fee which varies dependening on the fee that was set when the pool was created. Common fees are 0.05%, 0.1%, 0.3% or 1% but you should always check when performing a swap to ensure you are okay with the fee on that pool.\n\n## What is liquidity? \n\nLiquidity is the term for the amount of a token that is available to be swapped. The more liquidity a token has, the easier it is to swap that token.\n\n## What is a liquidity pool? \n\nLiquidity pools are pairings of 2 tokens that liquidity providers deposit tokens into. This enables DEX users to swap between any of the tokens in the pool.\n\n## What is a liquidity provider? \n\nLiquidity providers are users who deposit tokens into a liquidity pool. They are rewarded with a portion of the fees that are generated from swaps in the pool.\n\n## What is APY? \n\nAPY stands for annual perentage yield. In the context of BEX pools, this refers to the current APY for a given pool.\n\n## What is `$HONEY`? \n\nHONEYisthenativestablecoinoftheBerachainecosystem.Itisa‘USDC\\` backed stablecoin, and is used throughout the Berachain ecosystem.\n\n## Does it cost anything to mint or burn `$HONEY`? \n\nIn order to ensure stability, there is a small fee taken on every mint and burn of ``$HONEY``. This fee is currently set to 0.5% of the amount minted or burned and can be changed via governance proposals.\n\nAdditionally, because minting & burning requires a transaction, there will be a small gas fee in ``$BERA``.\n\n## What stablecoins can I mint `$HONEY` with during Testnet? \n\nThere are various USD-pegged stablecoins that can be used to mint ``$HONEY``. Currently, the following stablecoins are supported in testnet:\n\n-   stgUSDC\n\nMore tokens may be added based on governance.\n\n## What is ``$BGT``? \n\n`$BGT` is Berachain's staking & governance token. That means it is used to secure the network & earn rewards via Proof of Liquidity as well as to vote on governance proposals.\n\n## What is a Validator? \n\nA validator can refer to three things:\n\n1.  A blockchain node being run to validate transactions, produce blocks and come to consensus with other validators in the network\n\n2.  The entity that owns and operates the validator node\n\n3.  The blend of points #1 and #2 that manages a portion of Proof of Liquidity & Governance votes\n\nIn the case of ``$BGT`` station, we're referring to the #3, as ``$BGT`` station is here to help you decide which validators you'd like to delegate to.\n\n## Why should I delegate my ``$BGT``? \n\nDelegating ``$BGT`` allows you to participate in Proof of Liquidity while helping secure the network.\n\n## Why should I delegate my ``$BGT`` instead of burning it for ``$BERA``? \n\nRewards are the main reason.\n\nWith Proof of Liquidity, you can earn many different types of rewards:\n\n-   A share of protocol-provided incentives, provided in exchange for ``$BGT`` emissions directed to those protocols' Reward Vaults\n\n-   A share of Berachain core dApp fees, namely fees from Bend, BEX and Berps\n\n## How do I get ``$BGT``? \n\n``$BGT`` is earned through Reward Vaults when validators direct ``$BGT`` emissions towards Reward Vaults. See Earning ``$BGT`` for more.\n\n## What is governance? \n\nGovernance is the process by which the community decides what changes are made to the Berachain protocol. This includes how the node is upgraded and what parameters are set for various components on the chain.\n\n## Once you’ve provided liquidity into an eligible pool in BEX (or some other BGT-generating action like bend etc) how do you get ``$BGT``? Is ``$BGT`` automatically sent to recipients? \n\nEach eligible (whitelisted) pool on BEX has an associated LP token. Once liquidity is depositted into a BEX pool, an LP token would be issued relative the users total contribution percentage to the pool. With this LP token, users must stake (take an additional action) them into their respective Reward Vaults in order to be eligible to receive ``$BGT``. As validators direct ``$BGT`` emissions to Reward Vaults, a user will accumulate ``$BGT`` to claim. Users must perform an additional action to claim ``$BGT``, it is *NOT* automatically sent to the user.\n\n## Can only Validators vote on or create proposals? \n\nAnyone with ``$BGT`` can propose and vote on proposals.\n\n## What is the actual staking token of the network, ``$BERA`` or ``$BGT``? \n\n-   Validators stake ``$BERA``\n\n-   Network incentives are received in ``$BGT``\n\n## Can validators with ``$BERA`` alone build blocks and what are the rewards? \n\nYes, validators would get transaction fees and a ``$BGT`` base rate sent to their validator address.\n\n## Do incentives only go to the validators with ``$BGT`` delegated to them? \n\nIncentives going to the validator are adjusted for the amount of ``$BGT`` the validator distributes.\n\n## Can Reward Vaults route emissions to a single pool within a dApp, or only the whole dApp? \n\nThe dapp can request a Reward Vault for any encapsulated thing they want. The encapsulated thing just requires a representative ERC-20 token that users can stake in the vault. Developers also have the ability to stake in Vaults on behalf of users.",

            "Block Production and Emissions | Berachain Core Docs\n\n# Block Production and Emissions \n## Overview \n\nProof of Liquidity governs block production and token emissions on Berachain. This page explains the mathematical principles behind validator selection, block rewards, and emissions calculations.\n\n## Validator Selection \n\nThe network maintains an active set of N validators who are eligible for block production. Selection criteria include:\n\n-   Only top N validators by BERA stake are included in active set\n\n-   Block proposal probability is proportional to staked BERA and does not affect reward amounts\n\n-   Stake limitations per validator:\n\n    -   Minimum: 250,000 BERA\n\n    -   Maximum: 2,500,000 BERA\n\n## BGT Emissions Structure \n\nWhen a validator produces a block, BGT tokens are emitted through two emission components, which is variable based on the validator's boost:\n\n1.  Base Emission\n\n    -   Fixed amount equal to a `base rate` parameter (B)\n\n    -   Paid directly to block-producing validator\n\n2.  Reward Emission\n\n    -   Variable amount dependent on validator's boost (x)\n\n    -   Distributed to reward vaults selected by validator\n\n        -   Proportional to reward vault weights in reward allocation\n\n## Validator Boosts \n\nBoost (x) is a crucial metric that determines a validator's reward emissions:\n\n-   Calculated as the percentage of BGT delegation a validator has compared to the total BGT delegated in the network\n\n-   Expressed as a decimal between 0 and 1\n\n-   Example: If a validator has 1000 BGT delegated and the network has 10000 total BGT delegated, their boost would be 0.1 (10%) Higher boost leads to higher reward emissions, subject to the emission formula\n\n## BGT Emissions Per Block \n\nThe total BGT emitted per block is calculated using the following formula:\n\nemission\\=B+max(m,a+11+axb−1R)\n\nWhere:\n\n-   x = validator's boost (range: \\[0,1\\])\n\n-   boost = percentage of BGT delegation relative to total BGT delegated\n\n### Parameters \n\nParameter\n\nDescription\n\nImpact\n\nB (base rate)\n\nFixed amount of 1 BGT for block production\n\nDetermines baseline validator rewards\n\nR (reward rate)\n\nBase BGT amount for reward vaults\n\nSets foundation for reward emissions\n\na (boost multiplier)\n\nBoost impact coefficient\n\nHigher values increase boost importance\n\nb (convexity parameter)\n\nBoost impact curve steepness\n\nHigher values penalize low boost more severely\n\nm (minimum reward)\n\nFloor for reward vault emissions\n\nHigher values benefit low-boost validators\n\n### Sample Emissions Chart \n\nUsing the following sample parameters, we can visualize how emissions scale with BGT delegation:\n\nB\\=1.5,R\\=1.5,a\\=3,b\\=0.5,m\\=0\n\n## Max Block Inflation \n\nBGT emissions grow with the amount of boost a validator has, up to a cap.

            "Proof-of-Liquidity Frequently Asked Questions ❓ | Berachain Core Docs  \n\n# Proof-of-Liquidity Frequently Asked Questions ❓ \n## Can dApps that don't have a token still participate in PoL? \n\nYes, a fundamental aspect of Proof-of-Liquidity (PoL) is the use of whitelisted Reward Vaults. A protocol only needs to issue a receipt token that can be staked in the protocol's respective whitelisted Reward Vault. The receipt token is different from a native token and can be thought of as a form of bookkeeping token. For example, when a user provides liquidity to a BEX pool, they receive a receipt token in the form of an LP token.\n\n## Are there restrictions on what kinds of dApps can have whitelisted Reward Vaults? \n\nNo, any dApp can deploy a Reward Vault and submit it as a governance proposal to have it whitelisted.\n\n## What determines the APY for pools in BEX? \n\nRewards are determined by three things:\n\n1.  The amount of fees generated by the pool: This is determined by the total amount of swaps that happen in the pool and the fee that is set for the pool. The more swaps that happen, the more fees are generated. The higher the swap fee, the higher amount of fees generated per swap. However, swap fees should be set to a reasonable amount to ensure that users are not deterred from swapping in the pool.\n\n2.  The amount of ``$BGT`` emissions going to this pool: This is determined via votes made by the Berachain validators every epoch. Each validator can select which pools they would like to receive ``$BGT`` rewards and how much of the total ``$BGT`` emissions should go to each pool. The validator's ``$BGT`` rewards are determined based on the amount of ``$BGT`` delegated to them out of all ``$BGT`` delegated in the system. The more ``$BGT`` emissions that go to a pool, the higher the PRR for that pool.\n\n3.  The amount a user has staked in that pool's rewards vault: ``$BGT`` directed to the pool is distributed pro-rata to all of those staking that pool token for ``$BGT``.\n\n## Is the amount of BGT rewarded to a rewards vault proportional at all to the amount of liquidity (e.g. TVL) of that rewards vault? \n\nNo. There could be some proportion that the market could trend towards over time, but it's not something that is enforced.\n\n## Is the size of the BGT emission linear to the amount of BGT delegated to a validator? \n\nThe relationship between BGT delegated to a validator and BGT emissions is linear. There is a baseline BGT emission, even for validators with 0 delegation, and after that it scales linearly based on the amount of BGT delegated.\n\n## Can anyone stake BERA to become a validator? \n\nBeing a validator is currently permissioned, but this is expected to open up in the future.\n\n## Is there any difference between the ability for native dApps (BEX, Bend Berps) and external dApps to participate in PoL? \n\nNo, all rewards vaults must be approved through governance to be eligible to start receiving BGT emissions. For example, not all BEX pools will be able to earn BGT (by default, they're not whitelisted).\n\n## What is the difference between a “pool” and a “rewards vault”? \n\nGenerally, pools are referred to as deposits in DeFi protocols on Berachain. This might be receipt tokens representing LP on Dexes, lending positions, etc. rewards vaults are separate smart contracts which allow users to stake those pool tokens to earn BGT rewards (after being whitelisted for PoL).\n\n## Are rewards vaults created only by whitelisting governance proposals? \n\nTechnically, the creation of rewards vaults is permissionless, but for validators to direct BGT emissions to those rewards vaults, a governance proposal for whitelisting the rewards vault must pass\n\n## Can you give me an example of BGT voting power in relation to BGT emissions? \n\nValidator rewards will be proportional to the voting power. On Bartio, inflation is fixed at ~1500 BGT per block. If a validator w/ 25% of BGT voting power produces a block, they direct ~375 BGT to rewards vaults. Those rewards vaults pay an incentive per BGT emitted to it. So validator rewards are a function of its BGT delegation, because if a validator w/ 10% VP produces the block, they only get 150 BGT to distribute to rewards vaults.\n\n## I have concerns about hyperinflation of BGT. How does Berachain manage this? \n\nTraditional PoS systems have some percentage of inflation per year. Berachain just takes that PoS inflation and splits it into two components: 1 - Baseline yield for the block produced by a validator with just BERA stake and no BGT delegation. 2- A stake weight multiplier based on the amount of BGT delegated to that validator.\n\nWhere that PoS inflation = (1) + (2), basically where (2) is a weighted average of all validator’s BGT delegation, as it converges on the average emissions rate\n\nThe end result is that the inflation cadence should effectively mirror an equivalent PoS platform, it's just allocated differently\n\n## How do you manage to price the LP token, which in this case BGT? Does Berachain limit the number of pools receiving BGT to blue chips for security right? \n\nBGT isn't priced and it's not an LP token. It's a soulbound token that you earn by providing DeFi liquidity on Berachain. After whitelisting from BGT governance, free market dynamics dictate how much BGT is going to the pools. So it is likely that blue chips receive more BGT (as liquidity coalesces there), while long-tail assets receive less without incentives, all things being equal.\n\n## Why are incentives emission defined per BGT instead of being pool-based? \n\nIncentives are denominated in BGT– ultimately users want to be able to calculate per BGT im delegating/staking, so it's more of a choice of UI to facilitate understanding the value BGT drives.\n\n## Can only Validators vote on or create proposals? \n\nNo. Anyone with BGT can create or vote on proposals.\n\n## Can validator deposits ever be withdrawn, ie. if someone wants to “spin down” their validator? Do depositors earn yield / tips on their initial deposit of BERA? \n\nValidator deposits cannot be withdrawn until we enable EIP-7002. By waiting for the next hard fork we save a ton of engineering time and code complexity. Deposits are just to activate the validator--“depositing” in itself earns no yield.\n\n## Can validators with no BGT delegated to them build blocks? What kind of rewards will those validators earn when they build a block? \n\nYes, they can still build blocks. Those validators would only earn priority fees, they wouldn't earn any BGT.\n\n## Can rewards vaults route emissions to a single pool within a dApp, or only the whole dApp? \n\nThe dapp can request a PoL vault for any encapsulated thing they want. The encapsulated thing just requires a representative ERC-20 token that users can stake in the vault.\n\n## Do we cap the number of active validators (e.g. at 256). Is there a queue for entering the active set? \n\nThere will be a mechanism for capping validators to a safe level.\n\n## It claims that a validator node needs \"69,420 BERA\" to stake. Is this accurate? \n\n69,420 BERA is just a placeholder for now. We'll be finalizing the value a bit closer to mainnet.\n\n## Is there a maximum staking amount with a validator node? \n\nThere is no hard cap, but any additional bonded BERA wouldn't affect weight to proposal a new block.\n\n## What asset is at risk to be slashed for validators? \n\nBERA is the security asset and is at risk to be slashed.",

In doing so, protocols incentivize user of their protocol with ``$BGT`` rewards.\n\nValidators can direct emissions to protocols' pools through reward vaults, collecting these incentives in return. Validators are expected to redistribute received incentives to their ``$BGT`` delegators.\n\n## Reward Vault Whitelisting \n\nProtocols must complete these steps to whitelist a reward vault:\n\n1.  Deploy vault through factory contract\n\n    -   Specify single staking token\n\n    -   One vault per staking token allowed\n\n2.  Submit governance proposal for whitelisting\n\n3.

The active validator set consists of the top N validators ordered by BERA staked, with a 250K floor and 2.5M BERA cap per validator. Validators earn through three primary means:\n\n1.  Gas fees and priority fees\n\n2.  Collecting incentives provided by protocols for directing BGT rewards to their Reward Vaults\n\n3.  A base block reward (in BGT) for successfully proposing a block\n\n### Validator Incentives 💎 \n\nWhen a validator directs BGT emissions to a reward vault, they receive protocol-supplied incentives provided to attract these emissions (thus increasing the attractiveness of depositing into that protocol). These Incentives can be in the form of the protocol's native token or any other whitelisted ERC20 token.\n\nHere's how Incentives work:\n\n1.  A protocol sets an incentive rate for their reward vault (e.g., 10 protocol tokens per 1 BGT)\n\n2.  When a validator directs BGT emissions to this vault, they receive the corresponding amount of Incentives (e.g. 10 protocol tokens for directing 1 BGT)\n\n3.  Validators can take a commission on these Incentives before distributing the remainder to their BGT delegators\n\n4.  The amount of BGT a validator can direct (and thus Incentives they can earn) depends on their delegation weight\n\nProtocols compete for BGT emissions by offering attractive Incentive rates in their reward vaults, creating a marketplace where validators can optimize their returns by choosing the most profitable vaults.\n\n### Ecosystem Alignment ⚖️ \n\nSuccessful validators in PoL optimize for:\n\n-   Securing BGT delegation to increase their block rewards\n\n-   Efficiently exchanging BGT block rewards for protocol incentives\n\n-   Distributing value back to their BGT delegators\n\n## BGT Holders & Farmers 🥕 \n\nBGT holders play crucial roles in:\n\n-   Voting on governance proposals\n\n-   Influencing economic incentives through delegation\n\n-   Staking in reward vaults to earn more BGT\n\n> **Note**\nBGT that is delegated to validators is not subject to slashing. Only validators' BERA stakes can be slashed.\n\n### Earning BGT ⬇️ \n\nUsers can earn BGT by staking PoL-eligible receipt tokens in reward vaults. These receipt tokens are generated by performing actions that benefit the network, such as providing liquidity to a BEX pool.\n\n### Delegating BGT ⬆️ \n\nWhen delegating BGT, users typically consider:\n\n-   Which reward vaults validators direct emissions to\n\n-   Validator commission rates and incentive distribution strategies\n\n-   Validator uptime and performance\n\n## Ecosystem Projects 🧸 \n\nProjects can participate in PoL by:\n\n1.  Creating a reward vault through the factory contract\n\n2.  Submitting a governance proposal to whitelist the vault\n\n3.  Specifying accepted staking tokens and incentive rates\n\n4.  Managing incentive tokens and rates in their vault\n\nThe incentives marketplace allows protocols to bid for validators' emissions using whitelisted tokens, creating alignment between validators, protocols, and users. Projects must earn favor of BGT holders to have their Reward Vaults whitelisted into the PoL system.\n\nThis ecosystem alignment ensures that chain participants are incentivized to increase the overall value of the network, as rewards center around BGT while maintaining chain security through BERA staking.",
            "Proof-of-Liquidity Overview 📓 | Berachain Core Docs\n\n# Proof-of-Liquidity Overview 📓 \n\nProof-of-Liquidity (PoL) is an extension of delegated Proof-of-Stake (dPoS) that realigns economic incentives between validators, applications, and users. The key innovation is separating the chain's security (BERA)fromitsgovernanceandrewards(BGT).\n\nBerachain's Validator Active Set is determined by each validator's `$BERA` stake, with a minimum of 250,000 `$BERA` and a maximum cap of 2,500,000 `$BERA`. Within the Active Set, a validator's probability of winning a block is proportional to their staked `$BERA`—more `$BERA` staked increases the likelihood of proposing a block. The size of a validator's block reward in `$BGT` is determined by their Boost, which is a percentage of a capped amount of `$BGT` where the percentage is determined by a validator's `$BGT` delegation out of the total `$BGT` delegated to all validators.\n\n### Example \n\nGiven the following:\n\n-   1500 Max `$BGT` Rewards Per Block\n\n-   200 `$BGT` Delegated To Validator A\n\n-   1000 Total `$BGT` Delegated To All Validators\n\nValidator A has 20% of all `$BGT` delegated. If Validator A proposes a block, then they would receive (on top of the base `$BGT` rate): 1500 x 0.2 = 300 `$BGT` to use towards their Reward Allocations\n\nHere's how PoL works from the perspective of a validator:\n\n1.  A *Prospective Validator* stakes a minimum of 250K `$BERA` (with a maximum cap of 2.5M) to secure the network. Only the top N validators by `$BERA` staked become part of the Active Set, which would eligible to receive block rewards.\n\n2.  An *Active Validator* is chosen to propose a block with probability proportional to their staked BERA amount.\n\n3.  For proposing a block, the validator receives BGT emissions determined by two components:\n\n    -   Base emission (B): A fixed amount for building the block\n\n    -   Reward emission: A variable amount based on the validator's boost (percentage of BGT delegated to them)\n\n4.  The validator can direct their BGT emissions to whitelisted *Reward Vaults* in exchange for protocol Incentives. The amount they can direct is determined by the amount of BGT delegated to them.\n\n5.  A *Liquidity Provider* performs an action that generates a receipt token (e.g., providing liquidity to a BEX pool and receiving LP tokens)\n\n6.  The *Liquidity Provider* stakes their receipt token in a whitelisted *Reward Vault*\n\n7.  When validators direct BGT emissions to this vault, stakers receive BGT proportional to their share of staked receipt tokens\n\n8.  By earning BGT, the *Liquidity Provider* becomes a *BGT Holder*\n\n9.  BGT Holders can delegate their BGT to validators, increasing that validator's boost (x). Higher boost means larger BGT emissions when that validator proposes blocks. Validators are expected to share received protocol Incentives with their delegators.\n\n## Incentive Alignment 🤝 \n\nPoL creates alignment between:\n\n-   **Validators**: Need BGT delegation to maximize their block rewards and must efficiently direct emissions to reward vaults to earn Incentives\n\n-   **Protocols**: Compete for BGT emissions by offering attractive Incentive rates in their reward vaults\n\n-   **Users**: Earn BGT by providing liquidity, then delegate to validators who maximize returns\n\nProtocols can attract BGT emissions by:\n\n1.  Creating a reward vault\n\n2.  Getting it whitelisted through governance\n\n3.  Setting competitive Incentive rates\n\n4.  Maintaining sufficient Incentive token liquidity\n\n## Reward Vaults 🏦 \n\nReward vaults are smart contracts where:\n\n-   Users stake receipt tokens to earn BGT\n\n-   Validators direct BGT emissions in exchange for protocol Incentives\n\n-   Protocols manage Incentive rates (defined as a ratio of Incentive tokens per BGT emitted to the vault)\n\nKey points:\n\n-   Vault creation is permissionless but requires governance approval to receive BGT emissions\n\n-   Each vault can accept multiple whitelisted Incentive tokens\n\n-   Incentive rates can only be increased while tokens remain in the vault\n\nThis system ensures that chain growth benefits all participants while maintaining security through BERA staking.",
            "Reward vaults | Berachain Core Docs\n\n# Reward vaults \n\nReward vaults are smart contracts in which users can stake their Proof of Liquidity (PoL) eligible assets in order to receive ``$BGT`` rewards. Reward vaults are the only way in which anyone can earn ``$BGT`` rewards, and therefore serve the important function of gating entry into the PoL ecosystem.\n\nReward vaults are a key piece of infrastructure that allows protocols to leverage PoL, enabling teams to incentivize users' actions in exchange for BGT. A protocol can have multiple reward vaults, each with its own PoL-eligible asset to be staked. For example, BEX can have multiple pools earning BGT, each with its own reward vault and respective PoL-eligible asset.\n\n> **Note**\nA different reward vault contract exists for each PoL-eligible asset\n\n## User Interactions \n\n**Staking in a Reward Vault**\n\nIn order to receive BGT, a user must be staking the PoL-eligible asset in its reward vault. The protocol that deployed the reward vault is able to decide how the user acquires the PoL-eligible asset to stake. The idea is that protocols would leverage this to attract liquidity or stimulate activity, and in return award users with the asset they can stake in their vault.\n\n1.  The user takes some action that results in receiving a PoL-eligible asset, generally referred to as a receipt token.\n\n2.  The user stakes the PoL-eligible asset in the corresponding vault.\n\n3.  The user earns a portion of all the BGT emitted to that vault.\n\n**Earning BGT**\n\nThe amount of ``$BGT`` rewards a user earns from a reward vault is a function of:\n\n1.  The user's share of total assets staked in the reward vault\n\n2.  The amount of ``$BGT`` rewards emitted to the reward vault\n\nAfter staking assets in a reward vault, users are free to claim the earned rewards, add to their deposits, or withdraw their assets whenever they wish.\n\n`$BGT` farming with reward vaults is meant to resemble familiar DeFi actions, providing a low barrier to entry for regular users.\n\n## How ``$BGT`` Ends up in Reward Vaults \n\nValidators direct some portion of their ``$BGT`` emissions to specific reward vaults of their choice.\n\nTo understand why validators would choose to emit ``$BGT`` to a particular reward vault over another, refer to Incentives in PoL, which discusses how protocols can influence validator behavior with economic incentives.\n\n## Creation of New Reward Vaults \n\nNew Reward Vaults can be created permissionlessly, but must go through the Reward Vaults Whitelisting process, conducted by ``$BGT`` governance in order to be eligible to receive ``$BGT`` from validators. Developers or protocols can submit a proposal to whitelist a new reward vault for a specific PoL-eligible asset. If the proposal passes, the vault address is added to the list of approved reward vaults that validators can direct ``$BGT`` emissions to.\n\nHere you can learn about the Reward Vaults Whitelisting Process.",

Oftentimes, this is the main network token and is used for gas, staking, governance and economic incentives.\n\nHowever, because of Berachain's three-token Proof of Liquidity model, the functions of governance and economic incentives are separated into its own token. This token is ``$BGT`` (Bera Governance Token).\n\n``$BGT`` is non-transferrable and can only be acquired by providing liquidity in PoL-eligible assets (e.g. liquidity on Bex).\n\n## Earning `$BGT` \n\n``$BGT`` can be accumulated by performing certain actions in authorized dApps. Reward vaults correspond to some form of liquidity provided on Berachain, and are created after those pools are whitelisted (by ``$BGT`` governance). Users can subsequently deposit that liquidity in reward vaults to earn ``$BGT``. Some examples include:\n\n-   Depositing liquidity in the native Bex for an LP pair that is earning ``$BGT`` emissions\n\n-   Borrowing ``$HONEY`` on Bend\n\n-   Providing ``$HONEY`` in the `bHONEY` vault for Berps\n\n## What can you do with `$BGT`? \n### Governance \n\n``$BGT`` is used to vote on governance proposals. ``$BGT`` holders are responsible for a wide variety of ecosystem decisions, discussed in Governance. ``$BGT`` holders can either vote on proposals themselves or delegate their voting power to any other address. This governance delegation operates independently of delegating to validators for controlling ``$BGT`` emissions.\n\n### Earning Rewards \n\nProtocols can provide Incentives to attract ``$BGT`` emissions from validators. The amount that validators can earn in protocol incentives is determined by the amount of ``$BGT`` that is delegated to them. Thus, validators that return the maximum value to their ``$BGT`` delegators are likely to receive the most delegations.\n\nFurthermore ``$BGT`` delegators collect a share of Berachain core dApp fees, namely fees from Bend, BEX and Berps.\n\n### Burning for ``$BERA`` \n\n``$BGT`` can be burned 1:1 for ``$BERA``. This is a one-way function, and ``$BERA`` cannot be converted into ``$BGT``. This limits the ability to earn the chain's economic incentives solely to ``$BGT`` holders.",

This multi-collateral approach to ``$HONEY``'s backing enhances its stability and resilience.\n\n## How to Get `$HONEY`? \n\n``$HONEY`` can minted by depositing whitelisted collateral into a vault, and minting ``$HONEY`` against that collateral. Different assets eligible as ``$HONEY`` collateral are stored in different vault contracts. The minting rates of ``$HONEY`` are configurable by ``$BGT`` governance for each different collateral.\n\nAlternatively, ``$HONEY`` can be obtained by trading other assets on the Berachain Bex.\n\n## What determines which assets collateralize `$HONEY`? \n\nGovernance determines which assets can be used to mint `$HONEY`.\n\n## How is `$HONEY` Used? \n\nHONEYsharesthesameusesasotherstablecoins,suchasforpayments/remittances,andasahedgeagainstmarketvolatility.However,‘HONEY\\` also has a number of unique use cases within the Berachain ecosystem, including:\n\n### Lending - Bend \n\nBend uses ``$HONEY`` by letting users add to the bend's ``$HONEY`` liquidity pool and it earns interest on it by supplying.\n\nFor users that supply their ``$HONEY``, they receive an equivalent token as $aHONEY.\n\n``$HONEY`` is the only asset that Bend accepts to earn an interest on.\n\n### Borrowing - Bend \n\nBend also uses ``$HONEY`` as the base token that users can borrow against assets they provide as collateral.\n\n### Perpetual Futures - Berps \n\nBerps uses ``$HONEY`` as the base token for all trading collateral, payouts, and deposits. For example, in order to enter a levered long position in ETH, they must first deposit an appropriate amount of ``$HONEY``.\n\nAlternatively, ``$HONEY`` holders can passively earn by providing trading liquidity in the `$bHONEY` vault. `$bHONEY` vault depositors earn trading fees generated from Berps and serve as the counterparty to traders' positions. For example, if a trader gets liquidated, the ``$HONEY`` collateral of that position is distributed to those staking in the `$bHONEY` vault.\n\n## Minting `$HONEY` \n\nA flow diagram of the ``$HONEY`` minting process is shown below: !HONEY Minting\n\n### `$HONEY` Vaults \n\n``$HONEY`` is minted by depositing eligible collateral into specialized smart contracts called ``$HONEY`` vaults. Each vault is specific to a particular collateral type, with its own unique mint and redemption rate.\n\nIn the above example, the user deposits ``$USDC`` to mint ``$HONEY``. Only the ``$USDC`` vault in interacted with, and not the ``$USDT`` vault.\n\n### Vault Router \n\nAt the heart of the ``$HONEY`` minting process is the Vault Router contract. This contract acts as a central hub, connecting all the different ``$HONEY`` Vaults and is responsible for minting new ``$HONEY`` tokens.\n\nAs shown in the diagram, users' deposits are routed through the Vault Router contract to the appropriate vault. The Vault Router custodies the shares minted by the vault (corresponding to users' deposit) and mints ``$HONEY`` tokens to the user.\n\n### Fees \n\nFees collected from minting and redeeming ``$HONEY`` are distributed to ``$BGT`` holders. Fees are determined based on the mint and redemption rates of each vault. For example, if the mint rate of the ``$USDC`` vault is 0.995 (1 ``$USDC`` for 0.995 ``$HONEY``), then a fee of 0.005 or 0.5% is collected for every ``$USDC`` deposited.\n\n#### Example \n\nLet's consider an example with the following parameters:\n\n-   User wishes to deposit `1,000 `$USDC``\n\n-   Mint rate for ``$USDC`` is set at `0.995` (`99.5%`)\n\nHere's how the minting process would work:\n\n1.  The user deposits `1,000 `$USDC`` into the VaultRouter contract\n\n2.  The VaultRouter transfers `1,000 `$USDC`` to the `$USDC` Vault and receives `1,000` vault shares in return\n\n3.  The VaultRouter calculates the amount of `$HONEY` to mint:\n\n-   ``$HONEY`` to mint = Vault shares × Mint rate\n\n-   ``$HONEY`` to mint = `1,000` × `0.995` = `995 `$HONEY``\n\n4.  The VaultRouter mints `995 `$HONEY`` to the user's address.\n\n5.  The VaultRouter calculates and distributes the fee:\n\n-   Fee shares = Vault shares - ``$HONEY`` to mint\n\n-   Fee shares = `1,000 - 995 = 5 shares`\n\n-   The VaultRouter transfers 5 vault shares to the fee receiver.",
            "Berachain Testnet V1 vs V2 🆕 | Berachain Core Docs  \n\n# Berachain Testnet V1 vs V2 🆕 \n\n> On June 9, 2024, Berachain officially launched version 2 of its testnet called `bArtio`.\n\nThe Berachain `bArtio` network is a re-architecture of the chain to make it more modular and EVM-aligned. In order to achieve these goals, an entirely new framework was needed and **BeaconKit** was born.\n\nV2 is an implementation of the `BeaconKit` framework, which separates the execution and consensus, and focuses on implementing an consensus client that can be paired with any EVM execution client (Ex: Geth, Reth, etc).\n\n## Main Changes from V1 to V2 🐻 \n\nBerachain's V1 testnet (`Artio`) was built on top of Polaris, which tightly coupled EVM execution with the Cosmos SDK and introduced a monolithic framework for building highly optimized precompiles.\n\nDespite this optimization, Cosmos could not handle the volume of transactions that Berachain received, alongside the compatibility challenges that came with precompiles and supporting a forked EVM execution client.\n\nV2 introduced a modular architecture of separating the consensus and execution layer. Compared with V1, where validators would run a single Polaris client, V2 validators would need to run 2 clients, BeaconKit client (for consensus) alongside any EVM execution client (e.g. Geth, Erigon). This modular approach allows for specialization of concerns - for the execution layer to benefit from EVM innovations, and for BeaconKit to provide a highly customizable and performant consensus layer.\n\nIn addition to the technical changes with BeaconKit, the economic design of Berachain's native tokens has evolved. The following table highlights the main changes between V1 and V2:\n\nSome significant points to note:\n\n1.  ``$BERA`` is staked for activating validators, rather than ``$BGT``.\n\n2.  ``$BGT`` delegators no longer at risk of slashing.\n\n3.  The execution layer is now EVM identical.",

            "What is Proof-of-Liquidity? 🤝 | Berachain Core Docs  \n\n# What is Proof-of-Liquidity? 🤝 \n\nProof-of-Liquidity (PoL) is a novel consensus mechanism that aligns and increases the security of the chain by increased liquidity deployed on chain.\n\nPoL borrows from the Proof-of-Stake (PoS) concept of securing a chain by providing an initial stake with the native gas token. PoL builds upon PoS by introducing an additional soulbound governance token that both determines the potential reward weight for a staker, through delegation by others, and is rewarded to parties that have provided liquidity to the chain through governed reward vaults.\n\nThis separates token responsibility for gas and security from tokens used to govern chain rewards.\n\nFor Berachain, that is the native gas token `$BERA`, and the non-transferrable Berachain Governance Token (`$BGT`).\n\n> Read more in Proof-of-Liquidity Overview",

This means that it uses existing unmodified execution clients like Geth, Reth, Erigon, Nethermind, and more to handle executing smart contracts, and supports all the tooling that comes native with the EVM.\n\nIdentical means that whenever the EVM is upgraded, Berachain can adopt the latest version—for example, Dencun—straight out of the box.

            "BeaconKit Consensus Layer ⛵✨ | Berachain Core Docs  \n\n# BeaconKit Consensus Layer ⛵✨ \n\nBeaconKit is both a consensus client and framework for building EVM chains.\n\nBeaconKit leverages the CometBFT for its consensus algorithm, wrapped to interface with any EVM-compatible execution environment. As a consensus client it allows the network (an EVM blockchain like Berachain) to come to an agreement based on the data provided by the execution client.\n\nBy conforming to Eth2 modularity, where it separates consensus and execution, BeaconKit is able to leverage all the benefits that come with EVM execution clients. It is able to do this by adhering to the Engine API, which is JSON-RPC API that allows for communication between consensus and execution clients.\n\n## BeaconKit Benefits ✅ \n\nSome of the benefits that come BeaconKit are:\n\n1.  **Eth2 Modularity** - Adheres to separation of execution and consensus with communication via Engine API.\n\n2.  **Promotes Execution Client Diversity** - Any EVM execution upgrades can be supported out of the box. Avoids running and maintaining a custom forked EVM execution client to work with the chain.\n\n3.  **CometBFT** - Leverages a trusted consensus algorithm.\n\n4.  **Instant Finality** - Able to achieve Single Slot Finality / Instant Finality. Compared with Ethereum where finality is ~13 minutes.\n\n5.  **Leverages EVM Tooling** - All existing EVM tooling are supported. If a tool is supported by Ethereum it is supported by BeaconKit.\n\n6.  **Modular** - BeaconKit is also a modular framework which can allow for the potential of implemeting a custom block builder, rollup, data availability layer, and more.",

            "# Tierra V2 Walkthrough (Designers)\n\nPerson: 0xArata\nTags: Product\n\nLink to figma with flows (click on prototype in edit mode): https://www.figma.com/design/5wDZ9w2tQezqAuFNHBLG5m/tierra-v2-app-flow?node-id=0-1&t=NuOhF7WBdnJRIxU2-1\n\n## Summary & Context\n\nSince the first MVP/Concept we had in August this year, we have been sculpting and transforming Tierra to offer users a breath of fresh air in the SocialFi world.\nWithout going too far, we have discarded the initial idea of mixing the main concepts of Twitter/Instagram/Tiktok, which was essentially to focus our activity on posting and creating our own multimedia content. We still keep the idea of launching tokens but we have put it on the back burner to accompany it with other elements.\n\nTierra from now on will focus on 6 concepts:\n\n- Tracking of users' on chain activity.\n- User portfolio tracking (DeBank style). **(Already contemplated before)**\n- Creation of private spaces for KOLs and influencers in the purest friendtech style. Called Planets.\n- Launching of memecoins. Called Stars. **(Already contemplated before)**\n- Internal system of influence based on points. Earned through medals and quests.\n- Proof of Meeting, a new way to gain real influence that serves to counteract and balance the fact that a social application is only through a screen. PoM is a system that forces users to meet in real life to exchange their contact information via NFC technology (to be defined).\n\nAs we can see, we will have two types of users:\n\n- The content creator (KOLs, Influencers, Companies).\n- The consumer of that content.\n\nThe essential difference lies in the fact that the former will be the owners of these private spaces (Planets). These private spaces will have the capacity to:\n\n- Host a forum, where the content creator will be able to publish on the topics he/she considers (although we initially want to focus on financial topics). One way to visualise this is to take the example of reddit, where each sub-forum is a planet.\n- Publish events, both face-to-face and digital. Taking the example of Luma to promote the use of PoM among creators and users.\n- Private investments or other information that we/users consider useful in the future. Copy / Paste trading.\n\nAnother important point in the application is the ranking of influence. Users will be able to earn points through the PoM they have in addition to the internal/external quests that we will make available in our application to obtain badges. This will help users to really know who has a real reputation.\n\nHaving set a bit of context, let's move on to what we think are the most important screens and explain a bit about what's on each of them.\n\n---\n\n## App Walkthrough & Wireframes\n\n### Home\n\n![Screenshot 2024-11-07 at 18.33.20.png](Tierra%20V2%20Walkthrough%20(Designers)%201379e00f278680f18f4ade1ae5b2293e/Screenshot_2024-11-07_at_18.33.20.png)\n\nThe home screen will mainly collect users' on-chain “activities”. Similar to twitter, we will have two tabs: One led by the algorithm we implement (For you) and the other by the people the user follows (Following).\n\nThe activities comprise:\n\n- Transactions\n- Proof of meeting actions\n- Achievement of badges\n- Various investments\n- (TBD) Price action & Events\n\nThese activities will have the ability to be commented on (as we had previously with posts), liked, saved and shared.\nIn short, we simply replace posts with activities. We are going to recycle the old screens regarding “thread” and “commenting”.\n\nIn addition to the main content, at the top we can see 2 buttons and a carousel.\n\n- The buttons are simply, one to go to a screen where the user can manage their referrals, and the other to access their notifications.\n- The carousel will be a space where KOLs will be able to promote their planets.\n\n### Discover\n\nPlanets = Friend Tech Keys\n\nStars = Memecoins \n\nRockets = Users with access to Planets\n\n![Screenshot 2024-11-07 at 19.26.21.png](Tierra%20V2%20Walkthrough%20(Designers)%201379e00f278680f18f4ade1ae5b2293e/Screenshot_2024-11-07_at_19.26.21.png)\n\nOn the discover screen the user can explore Planets, Stars and the most influential users on the platform. There will also be a global search engine located in the top right corner.\n\nThe screen that derives from clicking on Stars, will be the one that we already have as explora in version 1, that is to say, where the tokens were categorised and where the user can click and see the details of any of those.\n\nFrom Planets will be derive another screen with a leaderboard of those planets and another search functionality, ie. another search bar. (This screen needs TBD in wireframe)\n\nLast but not least, we have the section with the profiles highlighted by the influence ranking. This is where PoM and the PoM Card concept comes into play. This will be an infinite scroll.\n\nThe PoM cards are an attractive element for the users where they will show their updated position in the ranking, their avatar, their username and the medals they are most proud of (the number is yet to be defined). These cards will be customizable (as if they were skins) by the users themselves, but they will always have the same skeleton that we have mentioned. Here we need you to put your efforts to get something very appealing to the user.\n\nAny user can follow those just by clicking the top right button inside any card.\n\nWe don’t know at the time of the creation of this document if we will add another screen if the user taps on one of these cards.\n\n### Control Panel\n\n![Screenshot 2024-11-08 at 15.38.36.png](Tierra%20V2%20Walkthrough%20(Designers)%201379e00f278680f18f4ade1ae5b2293e/Screenshot_2024-11-08_at_15.38.36.png)\n\nThis screen is where the user will be able to perform most of the actions in the application in terms of managing their experience on the ground.\nOn the one hand, you will have access to your PoM card in the ‘banner’ above, where you can see your position, points and medals you have achieved so far.\nBelow this, we can see 4 main sections:\n\n- Your Planets (where the user will be able to access the planets he has bought access to, and if he is a content creator, his own).\n- Your Stars: where the user will be able to access the tokens he follows and those he has launched (any user can deploy tokens).\n- Subscription: here the user can manage subscriptions to our platform. From here you will access a screen similar to the one in X (twitter) where all the features of each of the subscription levels are specified.\n- NFT (TBD): It is possible that we will dedicate a section to the NFTs, however it is an idea that we have not yet defined.\n\n### PoM Card\n\n![Screenshot 2024-11-08 at 15.55.17.png](Tierra%20V2%20Walkthrough%20(Designers)%201379e00f278680f18f4ade1ae5b2293e/Screenshot_2024-11-08_at_15.55.17.png)\n\nThis is the screen you access directly when you click on the card at the top from the control panel.\nHere a QR will be displayed (although it is likely that this will change to NFC technology) which users will be able to use to perform the PoM. This will be accompanied by their avatar at the top and, at the bottom, their username + the medals that the user wants to highlight.\n\nAll this information can be modified from an editing menu which can be accessed through the icon in the top right corner.\nThe idea is that users can have custom PoM cards, that is, they can change the background, the colour of the QR, the ‘case’ of the medals (which I haven't added in the wireframe, but it would be nice to have something like that), what badges he/she wants to show and so on.\nThis opens up an opportunity for us for both revenue and user growth within the application.\n\n### Planet View\n\n![Cell to Singularity: Evolution SS](Tierra%20V2%20Walkthrough%20(Designers)%201379e00f278680f18f4ade1ae5b2293e/IMG_D7F4FACF366B-1.jpeg)\n\nCell to Singularity: Evolution SS\n\n![Our wireframe](Tierra%20V2%20Walkthrough%20(Designers)%201379e00f278680f18f4ade1ae5b2293e/Screenshot_2024-11-08_at_16.15.47.png)\n\nOur wireframe\n\nThis is the main access screen to any planet, take the concept of this screen in a more gamified style. The user when entering here will see in the centre the planet in an idle state, surrounded by satellites (where users can access the different spaces that the Content Creator has to offer value, i.e. the forum, private events, investments, etc.). In other words, each satellite is a feature. The other type of element that will appear are animated rockets/ships that represent users who belong to this community.\nAll these elements will be animated. In addition, the user will be able to swipe inside the planet so that the community can get new and/or better features (TBD). We call this Slide to Earn.\nAs a reference to what we are proposing, I attach an image of a Tap Game called ‘Cell to Singularity: Evolution’.\n\n### Wallet (V1 and V2)\n\n![Wallet V1](Tierra%20V2%20Walkthrough%20(Designers)%201379e00f278680f18f4ade1ae5b2293e/Screenshot_2024-11-08_at_16.39.14.png)\n\nWallet V1\n\n![Wallet V2](Tierra%20V2%20Walkthrough%20(Designers)%201379e00f278680f18f4ade1ae5b2293e/Screenshot_2024-11-08_at_16.39.28.png)\n\nWallet V2\n\nHere we maintain the concept we had in August. We will simply extend the financial information to more than just tokens and points. The idea is to add 4 sections: Tokens, LPs, Locked and Investments.\n\n- **LPs**: Liquidity Pools or pairs where the user is invested.\n- **Locked**: Tokens that are invested in a Vesting Contract.\n- **Investments**: other types of investments (like a others section).\n\nThe existence of several versions is due to two stages of the App. *Pre-launch and Public Launch*.\nDuring the pre-launch (V1) we will have the old leaderboard that we have already designed. However, in the second version we will modify the **leaderboard for the PoM one** and we will add a new section/product which will be the **Tierra Vaults** (unique investment opportunities for our users).\n\nThe button in the upper right corner would allow the user to disconnect/change wallet.\n\nAnother highlight is to add a button (which I have represented with emojis 🐻⛓️) that will serve the user to add his BeraName on the platform (it is an ENS service in Berachain) and/or buy it through a pop up. \nAs a reference, I attach an image of the DeBank application so that you can understand where we got our inspiration from when we talk about the Tokens/Lp/Locked/Investments section.\n\n![IMG_00C3AE31EC96-1.jpeg](Tierra%20V2%20Walkthrough%20(Designers)%201379e00f278680f18f4ade1ae5b2293e/IMG_00C3AE31EC96-1.jpeg)\n\n![IMG_496BDB224A3D-1.jpeg](Tierra%20V2%20Walkthrough%20(Designers)%201379e00f278680f18f4ade1ae5b2293e/IMG_496BDB224A3D-1.jpeg)\n\n### Profile\n\n![Screenshot 2024-11-08 at 17.31.51.png](Tierra%20V2%20Walkthrough%20(Designers)%201379e00f278680f18f4ade1ae5b2293e/Screenshot_2024-11-08_at_17.31.51.png)\n\nThe profile screen will retain much of its design.\nWhat we are going to replace the tabs section we had before with another one that will contain the following cards:\n\n- PoM: where you will be able to consult with which people you have carried out the Proof of meeting action.\n- Activity: Similar to what we had before. Only now, depending on the user's subscription, we will show part of the information or all of it.\n- Badges: What medals the user has (the screen is attached in the next section).\n- Astronaut: where users will be able to see which planets (communities) you follow/have created and which stars (tokens) you follow/have created.\n\nIn addition, we will add both the settings and a display of activities that the user has liked/saved.\n\n### Badges\n\n![Screenshot 2024-11-08 at 17.37.10.png](Tierra%20V2%20Walkthrough%20(Designers)%201379e00f278680f18f4ade1ae5b2293e/Screenshot_2024-11-08_at_17.37.10.png)\n\nThis is the screen that can be accessed from the profile by clicking on the “Bagdes” card.\nThere are 3 elements to highlight:\n\n- The edit menu.

The idea is that we group in some way the features that the user will be able to access after the purchase of one of the subscriptions.\nEach feature could have an information button that will open a modal at the bottom of the screen providing detailed information, as well as an icon indicating whether it is available or not with the chosen subscription model.\n\n## From Wallet\n\n### Mint a Beraname\n\n![Screenshot 2024-11-22 at 18.06.20.png](Tierra%20V2%20Walkthrough%20(Designers)%201379e00f278680f18f4ade1ae5b2293e/Screenshot_2024-11-22_at_18.06.20.png)\n\nAfter clicking on the button where the bear and the chain are located, the user will access a modal where he/she can buy a beraname and use it in the app. The modal is taken from their own website. https://www.beranames.com/\n\n### PoM Leaderboard\n\n![Screenshot 2024-11-22 at 18.08.59.png](Tierra%20V2%20Walkthrough%20(Designers)%201379e00f278680f18f4ade1ae5b2293e/Screenshot_2024-11-22_at_18.08.59.png)\n\nAfter the public release of the app, our idea is to activate PoM in all its glory, including the influence system, or in other words, this screen. In it we will try to show an alternative version of the PoM cards (in horizontal), where we will include the same fields, position, avatar, username, medals and a follow button. Our idea is that this will be appealing, so the first 3 positions will have a different style than the rest of the list. Even more with the one that occupies the first position, since we will assign a greater space to it.\n\n## From Profile\n\n### Following/Followers\n\n![Screenshot 2024-11-22 at 18.14.47.png](Tierra%20V2%20Walkthrough%20(Designers)%201379e00f278680f18f4ade1ae5b2293e/Screenshot_2024-11-22_at_18.14.47.png)\n\nTypical screen where the user can consult the followers/followed/followed/followed in common that another user has in the form of a list.

The design of the cards should be quite similar to the PoM leaderboard, where we show, avatar, username, medals and position in the leaderboard.\n\n### Astronaut\n\n![Screenshot 2024-11-22 at 18.19.17.png](Tierra%20V2%20Walkthrough%20(Designers)%201379e00f278680f18f4ade1ae5b2293e/Screenshot_2024-11-22_at_18.19.17.png)\n\nAs we did with Your Planets/Your Stars, the screen that derived from the control panel, we will show the same information to the public on a single screen with two tabs.\n\n### PoM\n\n![Screenshot 2024-11-22 at 18.21.10.png](Tierra%20V2%20Walkthrough%20(Designers)%201379e00f278680f18f4ade1ae5b2293e/Screenshot_2024-11-22_at_18.21.10.png)\n\nIf you remember the higlighted profiles section of the discover screen, we used to show the PoM cards of the top users of the platform. The idea is to recycle those cards and put them in this screen, where the user will be able to access the PoM of the user he is consulting.\n\n### Activities\n\n![Screenshot 2024-11-22 at 18.23.39.png](Tierra%20V2%20Walkthrough%20(Designers)%201379e00f278680f18f4ade1ae5b2293e/Screenshot_2024-11-22_at_18.23.39.png)\n\nThis screen will show the activities of the user that is being consulted, we will recycle the same elements of the home screen.

In March of this year, Bloomberg reported that Berachain raised $69 million in its latest funding round led by Brevan Howard Digital and Framework Ventures. Upon completing this funding round, it expects to reach a $1.5 billion valuation.\n\nThis article will explore the Berachain ecosystem, including its three tokens and Proof of Liquidity consensus mechanism. First, we'll examine the Berachain EVM.\n\n## EVM Equivalent vs EVM Compatible\n\nThe Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) is Ethereum's runtime environment for executing smart contracts. It provides an isolated, secure space for running smart contracts on its blockchain. Furthermore, the EVM has a set of supported operations (opcodes), smart contract languages (like Solidity and Vyper), and tooling (Hardhat, Remix, and Foundry).\n\nSo, an EVM-equivalent blockchain seeks to replicate the entire environment and functionality of the EVM and support the same operations, smart contract languages, and tools. The goal is to create a seamless experience for users and developers transitioning from Ethereum to the new chain.\n\n## EVM Compatible\n\nAn EVM-compatible blockchain supports a degree of interoperability with Ethereum without replicating the entire environment. It could support smart contract languages and tools to a certain extent while maintaining differences in security, functionality, or performance.\n\n## Berachain EVM\n\nAs mentioned, Berachain is an EVM-compatible Layer-1 blockchain. Thus, it supports the same operations and tooling as the EVM while bringing additional functionality that optimizes for its Proof of Liquidity consensus mechanism. Therefore, the team considers Berachain an \"EVM-equivalent-plus\" blockchain.\n\n## Polaris EVM\n\nBerachain's technology is built on Polaris, a high-performance blockchain framework for building chains on top of the CometBFT consensus engine. The Polaris EVM provides the execution environment for Berachain smart contracts and is where Berachain's EVM compatibility emanates. Berachain developed the Polaris EVM to build a modular stack to separate the EVM runtime layer and provide an improved EVM experience.\n\n## CometBFT Consensus\n\nThe concept of Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT) has been around for decades but recently gained popularity due to the success of blockchain technology. Blockchain technology is a modernization of BFT. It provides a way for chains to handle machine failures even if the machine becomes malicious.\n\nCometBFT is a BFT middleware that securely replicates a state transition machine on many machines. It is a fork of Tendermint Core, and security is guaranteed so long as less than one-third of the machines on the network fail in any way. CometBFT consists of two primary components:\n\n1.  Its user-friendly and highly performant application interface.\n\n2.  The consensus engine is based on the Tendermint consensus algorithm. Tendermint ensures that all the machines record the same transactions and that they're in the correct order.\n\n## BERA, BGT, and HONEY\n\nBerachain has a tri-token system with BERA, BGT, and HONEY. BERA is sometimes called the \"gas token\" because it sends transactions on the blockchain. In other words, it pays for the transaction's gas. BERA tokens are available through various Berachain Testnet Faucets.\n\nBGT stands for \"Bera Governance Token.\" In PoS networks, blockchains use a governance token to secure the network through staking. Likewise, Berachain uses BGT for delegating in its Proof of Liquidity model. To acquire BGT, a user must first deposit liquidity in the BEX. On the BEX, users can swap tokens, provide liquidity to the BEX, and earn BGT rewards.\n\nBerachain uses HONEY to stabilize the protocol. It's a stablecoin that pegs approximately 1-to-1 with USDC. Users must first get BERA from a Berachain Testnet Faucet, then swap BERA for HONEY on Berachain's Native BEX.\n\n## Berachain Liquidity Pools\n\nBerachain offers flexible pool types to support various swap paradigms, weighted pools, and more. All of the pools adhere to a standard pool interface for user interaction.\n\nCreating pools is permissionless; thus, anyone can create a new pool on the BEX. First, the pool creator must determine the type of pool they want. Next, creators in the BEX must provide the liquidity to start the initial pool.\n\nCurrent pool types in the BEX include the Balanced Pool Type, which features a weighted asset pool. To create a Balanced Pool Type, the creator must configure and provide for the following:\n\n1.  The token set.\n\n2.  Between 2 to 8 tokens in the pool.\n\n3.  Initial liquidity.\n\n4.  Token weights in the pool.\n\n5.  The fee paid to Liquidity Providers during swaps.\n\nHere is an example: We have $100 worth of HONEY and want to pair it against BERA separately. In a traditional pool, the breakdown would look like this:\n\n$50 of `$HONEY` paired with $50 of `$BERA`\n\n$50 of `$HONEY` paired with $50 of $stgUSDC\n\nInitially, Berachain will launch a set of House Pools. The goal is to have these pools flush with deep liquidity so they can create MetaPools. A MetaPool contains at least one Liquidity Provider token. A Liquidity Provider token represents shares in a liquidity pool.\n\n## Proof of Stake Downsides\n\nNext, we'll look at Berachain's consensus mechanism. But to better understand Berachain's Proof of Liquidity consensus mechanism, let's first examine some of the disadvantages of Proof of Stake (PoS), a widespread consensus mechanism used in blockchain technology. In PoS consensus, token holders can validate transactions and create new blocks based on their stake, which the protocol holds as collateral.\n\nOne of the disadvantages of PoS is that improved security can lead to a reduction in liquidity. Participants stake tokens to become validators and delegators who receive rewards and secure the network. However, the stake can become centralized if newly minted tokens continuously go to the same participants. Below is a more complete list of the disadvantages:\n\n1.  Liquidity Issues: Securing the chain can lead to a reduction in liquidity.\n\n2.  Stake Centralization: The stake can become centralized.\n\n3.  Insufficient Validator Incentives: Validators can receive minimal rewards for their work securing the network.\n\nThus, Proof of Liquidity is a novel consensus mechanism developed to address some of the PoS model's shortcomings. It seeks to overcome the challenges faced by networks striving to remain decentralized and align network incentives between validators and the project ecosystem.\n\n## Proof of Liquidity Consensus Mechanism\n\nWith Proof of Liquidity, the goal is to increase security by increasing liquidity.\n\nBerachain's Proof of Liquidity addresses the above four issues with PoS through these various mechanisms:\n\n1.  Liquidity Issues: BGT (the delegation token) is separated from BERA (the gas token). Hence, the staking token differs from the one used for other on-chain actions. Users can only earn new BGT by providing liquidity to the BEX, which incentivizes further liquidity.\n\n2.  Stake Centralization: To address PoS centralization issues, Berachain distributes new BGT to liquidity providers. Because stake is distributed to separate market participants rather than directly to stakers, token inflation is more fairly and evenly distributed than in traditional PoS chains.\n\n3.  Insufficient Validator Incentives: Proof of Liquidity addresses the third issue with PoS by incentivizing protocols and validators to work together. Berachain aligns its goals by having validators incentivize a protocol's Liquidity Provider pool via BGT. Additionally, protocols help those validators accumulate more BGT stakes via bribes (see below).\n\nBerachain's Proof Of Liquidity model focuses on three objectives:\n\n1.  Build liquidity.\n\n2.  Solve the stake centralization challenge.\n\n3.  Align validator incentives with protocols.\n\nWith Proof of Liquidity, participants contribute liquidity to pools and receive governance tokens as a reward. These tokens are vital to the delegation process within the Proof of Liquidity system. In the case of Berachain, the governance token is BGT. Users add liquidity to BEX liquidity pools to earn BGT in return. They can then delegate their BGT tokens to validators.\n\nAs mentioned, a primary distinction of a Proof of Liquidity consensus is that the network's delegation and gas tokens differ. Berachain seeks to bolster liquidity, improve capital efficiency, and synchronize the project's ecosystem goals with the validators by decoupling these tokens.\n\nContributing liquidity to the BEX is the exclusive way to obtain new BGT tokens. This requirement motivates users to participate in liquidity pools and makes Proof of Liquidity a more active version of PoS, where delegators lend their tokens to a validator. With Berachain, the protocols receive all of the participants' liquidity. By bootstrapping liquidity, Berachain can accomplish more with fewer resources. That could be an essential distinction given all the new Layer 1s rolling out.\n\nSo, we've learned that Proof of Liquidity is an innovative consensus mechanism that addresses some of the issues found in PoS. Next, we'll explore Berachain's validators and their vital role in the network's security and consensus mechanism.\n\n## Validators and Delegators\n\nTo participate in Proof of Liquidity, users must acquire BGT tokens by providing liquidity to the BEX.\n\nIn Proof of Liquidity, validators earn BGT rewards when they propose a new block. These rewards include transaction fees and block rewards, which pay for their role. The network randomly selects validators to propose new blocks or attest to the validity of proposed blocks.\n\nRandom selection is weighted by the amount of BGT a validator has. Thus, validators produce blocks proportionally based on the amount of BGT delegated to them. The greater the delegation weight, the higher the validator's chance of block production.\n\nLuganodes is a AAA rated institutional-grade staking service provider for individuals and enterprises. Now you can take part in validating blockchain transactions and earn rewards. Learn about crypto staking with Luganodes here.\n\nA validator's stake weight determines two things:\n\n1.  How many blocks a validator produces in comparison to the other validators?\n\n2.  What percentage of future BGT emissions can their votes set?\n\nThe validator determines which Liquidity Provider pools are incentivized for users to deposit their tokens. The amount of BGT delegated to a validator determines the BGT inflation the validator controls. BGT inflation directed towards the native BEX liquidity pools means deeper liquidity for those pools.\n\nLet's assume a validator has 5% of all the staked BGT delegated to them. That validator controls 5% of where future BGT inflation will be directed.\n\nThose who don't want to be a validator can acquire BGT and delegate their tokens to network validators to earn more BGT by providing liquidity to the BEX liquidity pools. Those who don't want to delegate their BGT tokens to earn rewards can burn them for BERA.\n\nBGT tokens delegated to a validator can be used to create and vote on governance proposals. After a validator receives BGT rewards, they are responsible for sharing a percentage of the awards with specific liquidity pools through a precompiled contract called \"Berachef.\" BGT incentivizes validators to behave honestly. Validators also get to vote on future BGT inflation across multiple liquidity pools.\n\nThe amount of BGT rewards earned by a user for staking liquidity per pool is based on a few factors like the BGT amount emitted to that pool and the amount of liquidity that the user provided to that pool (out of all liquidity in the pool)\n\nThe main takeaway is that delegators and validators receive rewards, creating a symbiotic ecosystem where all parties benefit.\n\n## Berachain’s Cutting Boards\n\nBreaking down which Liquidity Provider pools will receive future BGT inflation is called creating a \"Cutting Board.\"\n\nValidators can choose to split up their Berachef weights in different ways. One Liquidity Provider pool could receive 100% of the BGT inflation emissions, or multiple Liquidity Provider pools could receive percentages of the validator's BGT inflation emissions, which total 100%.\n\nFor example, 75% of the BGT inflation could go to BERA/HONEY and 25% to the USDT/HONEY pool.\n\n## Bribe Mechanics on Berachain\n\nIn most contexts, \"bribe\" is an unsavory term and can even describe an illegal action. However, with Berachain's Proof of Liquidity model, Bribes are a way for validators to incentivize network participants to delegate BGT tokens to them instead of others.\n\nValidators offer Bribes to their BGT delegators, and it's a way for validators to differentiate themselves from the crowd of other validators above and beyond the standard metrics for gauging validator performance.\n\nFor validators that have created Bribes, they are distributed to their delegators as follows:\n\n-   A Bribe is handed out each time a validator chosen for the Bribe proposes a new block.\n\n-   Bribes can be set for a future epoch but must be set before the epoch begins.\n\n## Summary\n\nThe testnet is live now, and Berachain's mainnet is set to launch in the second quarter of 2024. With its innovative Proof of Liquidity model, Berachain is poised to better align the incentives across its ecosystem and could play an influencer role in how Web3 platforms use liquidity.\n"
